# Episode 7 - Second Contact

## Briefing
The Valkyrie's landing crew convened to discuss their next move, having lost contact with the mothership and facing the presence of the Empire on the planet.  Their initial plan was to locate the Empire's lander, hoping to gather intel and potentially use it for communication.

## Control Room A
Following Garrik's lead, the team trekked back towards the cave system where they previously encountered the Myconids.  They climbed the rusted metal staircase, the air growing thinner as they ascended.  A bright white flash momentarily filled the observation panels as they entered the control room.    

Inside, they found the workstations stripped bare, but fresh boot prints marked the dusty floor.  The tracks led to the console and then towards an access hatch in the ceiling.  Causticus, examining the console, discovered that the Empire had recently removed their hacking module.  The logs revealed that the laser defense system had been fired twice in the past 300 years – once 17 days prior and again three days ago when the team was attacked.    

## Ascent to the Mountaintop
Caelen, peering through the hatch with an extendable camera, found only a vertical maintenance shaft.  The team decided to proceed further up the mountain.  Their climb was anything but stealthy, the old metal ladder groaning and breaking under their weight.    

They emerged onto the mountaintop, greeted by a vast optics array and a large bird's nest.  Nearby, they discovered the Empire comms officer, Indigo March, bleeding and unconscious from what appeared to be Myconid attack.    

## Contacting the Valkyrie
The team decided to let Indigo March succumb to her injuries, and Causticus quickly salvaged her equipment.  Among the electronics, they found a short-range receiver containing Empire credentials and encryption keys. Messages on the receiver indicated the Empire’s priorities in the star system: to learn about the mysterious Neutronium and how it may be manufactured to construct Dyson spheres and other advanced engineering works. 

Causticus, with a masterful touch, established a direct uplink with the Valkyrie.  Captain Douji responded immediately, demanding a status report. The crew informed Captain Douji about the Empire's presence and their downed lander.  The captain, in turn, revealed the mission's true objective: to investigate the disappearance of Trappist-1's starlight, a potential sign of an advanced alien civilization.

## Rescue Mission
Captain Douji made a controversial decision to bring the Valkyrie down to the planet, despite the risks associated with its antimatter drive.  The crew, recognizing the potential danger, urged her to reconsider.  The captain agreed to give them 24 hours to locate the Empire lander and potentially use it to return to orbit.    

## Securing the Laser Station
Before leaving the mountaintop, the team secured the laser station and set up various countermeasures to protect their newfound communication hub.  They rigged traps and a sensor alert system, ensuring they would be notified if anyone approached.    

## Under the Wall
Following the coordinates from Indigo's communicator, the team descended back into the cave system and headed towards the eastern end of the wall.  They stumbled upon an underground facility where they found Jensen and Gary Gallagher, along with two Graftian soldiers.    

## Rescue and Recovery
The situation escalated quickly, with the team freeing Jensen (but not Gary) and engaging in combat with the Graftian soldiers.  They followed Jensen deeper into the facility, pursuing the rest of their captured crew.    

## Confrontation in the Throne Room
The team emerged into a grand throne room, where they found the queen holding their allies captive.  A tense battle ensued, with the crew facing off against the queen, her android guards, and the remaining Graftian soldiers.    

## Turning the Tide
Despite the queen's formidable defenses and the overwhelming odds, the team managed to turn the tide of the battle.  Acolyte's strategic commands, Grace's calming influence, and the combined might of the crew pushed back the queen's forces.    

## Escape and Aftermath
The queen, fearing for her safety, triggered a window explosion and leaped out, leaving her remaining forces to their fate.  The crew, victorious but exhausted, regrouped, having rescued their captured comrades and gained valuable insights into the planet and its inhabitants.
