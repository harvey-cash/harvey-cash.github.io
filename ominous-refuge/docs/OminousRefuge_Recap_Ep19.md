# Episode 19 - Fate Lies

## The Captain's Last Words
As the survivors turned to leave Fate’s quarters, their eyes fell upon a collection of exquisite cybernetic augmentations and prosthetic limbs, spare parts for their enigmatic foe. Garrik’s wrist, shattered by Primus Rex, hung uselessly. Passing the captain’s body, slumped in the doorway, Joseph Acolyte paused to pay his respects. He knelt, and in the dim light, he saw it. Scrawled on the floor in her own blood, Captain Zhan Douji’s dying message was clear: FATE LIES.

Garrik scoffed. “Fate always lies. Nothing surprising.”

The words, however, hung in the air, a seed of doubt planted. Outside, the scene was grim. Tanath, leader of the Drybridge scouts, lay coughing and bleeding, his daughter Triss cradling his head. Her eyes, streaked with tears, burned with livid anger. “Malik,” she spat, looking up at the crew. “Malik killed them. Cut down all of his countrymen and women. For what? To protect this place? To protect that Queen? To forsake us? We have to kill Malik.”

The weight of their losses and the mystery of their circumstances pressed down on them. An intelligence scan of the fallen Graftians revealed a startling fact: the pacifying drug administered through the food and water, which previously rendered them unconscious if they became violent, had seemingly worn off. These people had fought back. They had died fighting.

## An Unlikely Ally
The crew decided their best course of action was to find the White Colossal. Unlike the others, it had never been directly hostile, its droids only ever attempting to restrain them. With Fate planning to unleash a virus and Malik on a rampage, the Colossal might be their last remaining asset.

They made their way back through the long, semicircular hallway to the hole Joseph had blasted in the enclosure wall. Outside, they found it. The hulking form of the White Colossal was curled up, its chin resting on its coiled body like a sleeping serpent. At its feet lay two figures: the fragmented, destroyed remains of its white-and-gold neutronium avatar, and a frail, weary Security Officer Jenson, both of his legs missing.

“The white wolf, finally brought down,” Jenson rasped, dazed but awake. “Didn’t expect it was gonna go like this.” The amputations were old wounds, he explained, relics from Federation raids before he’d turned informant for the Empire. He seethed with a desire for revenge, trying to crawl towards Garrik, but the Colossal’s eye opened, calmly tracking his movement. It was a look not of control, but of deep, weary depression. Defeat.

“What’s this creature been doing?” Caelen Vesir asked.

“Picked me up from where the Queen’s Guard stripped me of my armour and left me hanging,” Jenson explained. “And it just put me here. Its avatar was trying to speak Galactic Common, saying stuff like ‘You’re all safe here’ and ‘We will take care of you.’ Then, bang. Fate destroyed it.”

Causticus attempted to interface with the avatar’s remains. While no active systems could be found, she determined it was a telepresence robot, controlled wirelessly by the Colossal. Crucially, its design was a near-perfect match for Queen Carolina’s own avatar.

As they processed this, the White Colossal stirred. It rose, ripped a section of electronics from the ceiling, causing the holographic sky to fizzle out, and pulled down a large, alien projector. It plugged a cable from its own body into the device, and words appeared on the flickering display in Galactic Common.

I’M SORRY.

The text continued, flickering and changing. MY MATE SAID THAT YOU WERE FROM BEYOND THIS STAR SYSTEM. SHE TRIED TO DESTROY YOU. TO STOP WORD OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE FROM GETTING OUT TO OTHERS OF OUR KIND.

It explained its mission. They were activists who had come to protect the sentient life in this system, hoping to prove that a hole could be left in the Federation’s energy-collecting Dyson Sphere array without destabilizing it. A case study for a more compassionate future. But their ancestors, driven by money and power, would not approve. WE WANTED THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT, it typed, the correction from past to present tense hanging in the air.

The Colossal revealed that it had convinced the others to intervene and stop its mate, Carolina, after her violent turn. They had locked her in her sensory deprivation chamber—the immersion tank required to control the avatars—but the other Colossals had since disappeared. Now, it believed Malik and the Queen’s Guard were attempting to free her.

“How can we stop her?” Causticus asked.

The Colossal offered to unlock the doors between them and the chamber, but warned that Carolina had secured some doors with controls only she possessed. It confessed its core purpose was to preserve humanity, which was why it hadn’t fought Fate directly. After an impassioned, collective plea from the crew, the creature finally agreed to help.

I WILL RESTRAIN. I WILL NOT HARM.

With that, fifty golden, neutronium sandworm-droids converged on their location, standing ready. The Colossal’s one condition was that the crew must take the rest of the Graftians and leave the star system, leaving it to deal with its mate.

The Dead Man's Switch
A new, desperate plan formed. Jenson revealed that his power armour—the very same armour now worn by Malik—was fitted with a bomb, rigged to a dead man’s switch. An antenna in his heart, powered by its beat, sent a constant signal to prevent detonation. If his heart stopped, the bomb would go off.

“Kill me,” he urged. “And then Joseph can bring me back to life like he did to Gabriel, Sandro’s dad.”

Resurrection technology required a diamond of significant value, which they did not have. The Colossal, however, could fabricate the necessary components, but it would take time—time they didn’t have, as Fate and Malik progressed their own plans.

Causticus proposed a different solution: hacking the dead man’s switch. But Jenson explained the antenna was surgically implanted inside his heart. A Faraday cage could block the signal, but building one was impractical. The most direct path remained stopping his heart.

After a tense debate—open-heart surgery versus a quick death—they decided to first locate the armour and assess the situation. Led by the Colossal and their new sandworm entourage, they proceeded down the indicated hallway.

## Confrontation in the Control Room
A massive door slid open, revealing an alien control room. Vegetative plants reminiscent of Graft grew at a colossal scale. Fate was there, perched casually atop the inert body of Primus Rex. Cables extended from her cybernetic dreadlocks, plugged directly into the machine, which hummed and whirred with the work of synthesis. Nearby, Queen Carolina’s orange avatar stood strapped to a vertical gurney, shackled and inactive.

Blocking their path stood Malik, clad in Jenson’s white and red power armour, flanked by an array of Queen’s Guard. On the other side stood Eesha, Ermine’s former bodyguard, her weapon aimed squarely at them. Behind them all, the true Queen Carolina floated in her sensory deprivation tank, her eyes filled with livid rage as she watched, helpless.

The moment the door opened, all eyes turned, and weapons were raised.

“You are all traitors to humanity,” Eesha declared, her voice cold. “Traitors to the Federation.”

Caelen argued, pleading logic. He explained that the Colossals were a small band of scientists, and declaring war would invite the wrath of their entire military civilization.

“Your logic is flawed,” Eesha retorted. “I am following the orders of the highest authority of the Federation. You have betrayed us.”

A quick scan by Causticus confirmed the bomb was still active within the power armour Malik wore. The blast would be enough to kill him and a few nearby guards, but not enough to wipe out the entire room, and it wouldn't harm the crew from their current distance. The problem was getting Malik close enough to Fate.

A new plan was hatched. Causticus, using archived audio recordings of Queen Carolina, stitched together a short message. Grace, using her communication tech, broadcast it directly to Malik’s earpiece, bypassing his regular comms.

“Come to me now,” the Queen’s voice demanded in his ear.

Confusion crossed Malik’s face. He ordered his guards to watch the intruders and walked toward the inert avatar. Fate looked up from her work, annoyed. “If you come any closer, you’re going to interfere,” she warned.

They began to argue, but Malik was still just outside the bomb’s effective blast radius to kill Fate. Causticus, with a surge of inspiration, hacked the power armour’s actuators, forcing Malik to take two involuntary steps forward, directly into the optimal position.

The moment was now. There was no time for subtlety. Caelen lunged forward, plunging a plasma knife directly into Jenson’s chest.

Time seemed to slow. Jenson gasped. An instant later, the far side of the room erupted in a ball of fire. Malik and the power armour were vaporized. The explosion caught a chunk of Primus Rex’s body and blasted Fate from her perch. Her head snapped back as the cables connecting her to the machine went taut, and she fell out of sight behind the hulking chassis.

Chaos ensued. The White Colossal’s sandworms, acting on their prime directive, immediately grabbed and restrained Caelen for harming a human. The jittery Queen’s Guard opened fire, but the crew dodged behind the cover of the other sandworms.

“STOP!” a voice boomed around the room, translated by Joseph’s tech. It was Queen Carolina, her voice projected from the tank. “THIS ENTIRE PLACE WILL BE DESTROYED IF FATE DIES. SHE MUST LIVE.”

The crew remembered: the missing antimatter core from the Valkyrie. Fate had a dead woman’s switch of her own.

## The Truth and the End of Fate
As the smoke cleared, Causticus took aim and severed the remaining cables connecting Fate to Primus Rex’s body. The sandworms, convinced by Caelen’s desperate explanation of Jenson’s self-sacrifice, released him.

Grace, scanning the control room displays, noticed a feed showing a Federation battleship in the system—the cavalry Fate had mentioned. But something was wrong. The captain’s last words, FATE LIES, echoed in her mind. Fate had no clear credentials.

A moment of insight struck Joseph. Eesha was sprinting not to save the station from an antimatter explosion, but only to save her commanding officer. And with Captain Douji dead, the highest-ranking Federation officer present was Commander Ermine Lakeford. Fate was not in the chain of command.

“Listen!” Joseph commanded, his voice amplified by tech, compelling Eesha to halt. He laid out the truth: Fate had no official authority. Her identity scans were blank. She had arrived with Ulric, a known Syndicate plant. She had stolen half of Primus Rex’s brain to learn of his plans.

Crawling out from behind the machine, badly burned, Fate looked terrified. The weight of the deception seemed to crush Eesha, who sank to her knees. Ermine went to her, embracing her.

Just then, a neutral voice emanated from Primus Rex’s body. SYNTHESIS COMPLETE. COLOSSAL KILLER.

Joseph cast a zone of truth field around Fate.

“Who sent you?” Causticus demanded.

“Nobody fucking sent me!” Fate spat. “The Federation is an incompetent bureaucratic mess, and it needs someone to sort it out.”

“Is there an antimatter bomb?” Caelen asked.

“No,” she admitted, the truth field compelling her honesty. “We dumped the core before we landed on Graft. I’m not suicidal.”

She confessed her entire plan: to use the synthesized virus to kill the Colossals, use Carolina’s avatar as a mouthpiece to control the Graftians, and then use the Dyson Sphere to enforce her own brand of perfect, harmonious order on the galaxy.

As Causticus moved to restrain her, Fate pulled her close. “I’m not so stupid that I wouldn’t have some sort of dead woman’s switch on me,” she hissed. Her body tensed, her eyes glazed over, and she detonated herself in a small, contained blast.

The explosion ripped through Causticus, tearing off a leg and shredding her arms. But before she could bleed out, sandworms rushed in, carrying Fate’s own cybernetic augmentations from the Valkyrie. With surgical precision, they began grafting the superior tech onto Causticus’s ruined body, saving her life and, in the process, transferring Fate’s high-level administrative credentials over all Federation systems to her.

## Escape
As the White Colossal confronted a now-smashing-the-glass Carolina, Causticus acted. She took Jenson’s still-viable brain and, with a grim determination, installed it into the now-empty chassis of Primus Rex. The massive war machine whirred to life.

“Now this is what I’m talking about,” Jenson’s voice boomed from the machine.

The crew voted. They would honour their promise to the White Colossal and leave Carolina to it. They would escape. Jenson, in his new body, scooped them up and sped back to the Valkyrie. The ship’s power was restored, a new neutronium core installed by the droids. Grace, her administrative authority also restored by a tiny robotic fly, coordinated the evacuation of the 200 surviving Graftians.

The Valkyrie ascended through a newly blasted hole in the surface of Vexis, leaving the two Colossals to their fate. As they reached orbit, two ships appeared on their scanners: the Federation battleship and, emerging from stealth, an Empire interstellar vessel. Both hailed them, offering safe passage.

A final choice had to be made. Return to the bureaucratic Federation? Defect to the unknown Empire? Or forge their own path?

The decision was unanimous. They would go their own way.

As the two capital ships watched, a wormhole of unknown origin tore open in front of the Valkyrie. The ship’s boosters fired, propelling it through the shimmering portal, which snapped shut behind them, leaving the Trappist-1 system and all its chaos behind. They were free, headed for an unknown, independent future among the stars.
