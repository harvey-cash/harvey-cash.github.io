# Episode 4 - Drybridge

## Introductions
Grace, having already interacted with the tribal people, shared the details of her conversation with the team.  She had established that they were perceived as a tribe from the sky and were there to establish a friendly relationship.  The tribal scout leader, Triss, mentioned other outlanders like themselves, but the details were scarce.    

A discussion ensued among the team members, with questions arising about Grace's proficiency in the local language and the unknown outlander tribe.  Caelen inquired about the locals' disposition and whether they should be prepared for hostility.  Grace assured them that the locals seemed welcoming and that her primary concern was the unknown outlanders.    

Causticus raised suspicions about Grace's knowledge of the language, questioning how she could communicate with people so far removed from Federation space.  Grace vaguely attributed her language skills to her role as a xenoanthropologist and her preparation for the mission.    

Suspicions and Revelations
Ermine pointed out that having a means of communication with the local populace would significantly aid in achieving the Federation's diplomatic goals.  She expressed concern over Grace withholding information that should have been mission-wide.    

In response, Grace emphasized that she was merely a xenoanthropologist from a university, invited for her qualifications, and not a Federation official.  She urged them not to question her presence, as it would be akin to questioning the Federation's higher powers.    

## Dyson Sphere
As the team observed the tribal warriors looking towards the sky, they realized that the two moons, Lyria and Vexis, were missing.  They remembered that the moons had unusually low density, suggesting they had been hollowed out.  The warriors, Triss and Tanath, were conferring in hushed tones, their debate seemingly centered around the absence of the moons.    

Caelen, having previously hypothesized that the star Trappist-1 was surrounded by a Dyson sphere with a system of lenses, now considered the possibility that the moons, being far out from the planet, might not be included in the ray of sunlight.  Upon closer examination, Caelen confirmed the presence of the moons, faintly illuminated by reflected light from the planet itself.    

Acolyte, observing the religious sentiment of the warriors towards the moons, heard them repeating the words "Lyria" and "Vexis."  He shared his observation with the team, and together they realized the religious significance of the moons for the tribal people.    

## Background Checks
Meanwhile, Ermine and Causticus delved into Grace's background.  They discovered that she was indeed from a planet recently absorbed into the Federation.  The absorption had led to the homogenization of the planet's culture, with Federation media and businesses replacing the local culture.  They found social media posts from Grace expressing dissatisfaction with the loss of her homeworld's heritage.    

## A Cyborg's Concerns
Caelen, still wary of Jensen after a prior incident on Earth, engaged him in a conversation.  He expressed his concern about Jensen's aggressive behavior and emphasized the importance of responsible weapon handling.  Jensen, however, bluntly stated his dislike for Caelen, stemming from the incident on Earth where Caelen had fatally shot a civilian.    

## The Moons and the "Great Vexing"
The team decided to return to the warriors' camp.  Upon their return, Triss and Tanath explained the significance of the moons in their belief system.  Lyria was the moon goddess, the creator of all life, while Vexis was the trickster who brought the curse of nighttime upon the land.    

Tanath recounted the events of the "Great Vexing" that occurred 80 years ago, where the trickster Vexis cursed both moons, causing them to lose their ability to illuminate the planet.  This led to nocturnal creatures losing their nightlight and competing with humans, resulting in chaos and destruction.    

## The Basin Clan and the "Mountains"
The team learned that the Basin Clan had inhabited the area since time immemorial and that their shamans held daily ceremonies to inform everyone of their heritage.  The "mountains" (skyscrapers) had always been there, impossibly large and beyond human interference.    

Acolyte inquired about the relationship between different clans and learned that they mostly kept to themselves, with occasional negotiations facilitated by their shamans.  The Basin Clan was surprised by the recent arrival of people from the north and the sky.    

## Drybridge
Tanath then formally invited the team to Drybridge, a settlement at the base of an ancient, rusting metal wall.  As they followed the warriors, they noticed the smell of salt in the air, despite being far from the coast.  The terrain gradually transitioned from spongy moss to dry sand, causing the camel-horses to stumble.    

## The Wall
Upon reaching Drybridge, the team was struck by the sight of the massive wall, its metal and stone construction hinting at advanced engineering beyond the capabilities of the local tribes.  The presence of salt water puddles in the desert environment led them to believe that the wall was some kind of dam.    

Tanath welcomed them to Drybridge and offered them basic food and water.  He asked them not to stray too close to the wall, as the people there might not be welcoming towards strangers.    

## Impatience and Frustration
Days passed, and no one of any importance came to meet the team.  They complained to Tanath, but he urged them to be patient, assuring them that their case was being argued.    

Causticus expressed frustration with the lack of progress and questioned the need for such a lengthy procedure.  Grace asked about the other outlanders, and Tanath revealed that they were being kept elsewhere in Drybridge, closer to the wall.  Acolyte inquired further, learning that the other outlanders had also been waiting for weeks and had not yet met with the queen.    

## A New Plan
With no progress being made, the team decided to take matters into their own hands.  They proposed going to the market to gather information and potentially make contact with someone who could help them gain access to the royal district.  Caelen suggested crafting disguises to blend in better, but the intricate ceramic tile clothing of the locals proved difficult to replicate.    

## The Market
At the market, the team observed the bustling trade and the various goods being exchanged.  They noticed the lack of symbols and glyphs in the locals' attire and surroundings, further emphasizing the unique nature of this civilization.    

A storekeeper, intrigued by Causticus's cybernetic features, offered to trade garments for pieces of her armor.  She agreed, exchanging some of her redundant cybernetic parts for clothing.    

## Grace's Deception
Meanwhile, Grace attempted to sneak away from the group, but was spotted by Acolyte and Causticus.  When confronted, she claimed to be seeking information but could not be transparent with them yet.    

Causticus questioned Grace's motives, pointing out the importance of learning about the local culture.  Grace retorted that she was trying to do just that, but their actions were getting in the way.    

## Jensen's Secret
Acolyte, remembering the captain's instructions to be vigilant, questioned Grace about her knowledge of the language.  Grace insisted that the language stemmed from the Federation's common language.    

The team then turned their attention to Jensen, who had been unusually quiet throughout the ordeal.  Under pressure, Jensen inadvertently revealed that he knew how Grace could speak the language.    

## A New Arrival
Before Jensen could explain further, a man in similar clothing emerged from a side alleyway.  He praised Jensen for his work and apologized to Grace for the stress caused by her crew.  He then invited them to follow him, promising more productive diplomacy with the planet's natives.    

The session ended with Ermine recognizing the mysterious man, her jaw dropping in surprise.
