# Episode 5 - Meet the Empire

## Garrik's Exploration
Following the fight at the crashed lander, Garrik, still reeling from the chaos, discreetly exited the scene and entered a nearby cave system. His mission: to locate a dense mineral known as Neutronium, a substance he had only theoretical knowledge of. Equipped with a density scanner, Garrik ventured deeper into the damp, moss-covered caverns. Initial readings proved inconclusive, the Neutronium appearing diffusely spread throughout the cave.

Reaching a fork in the tunnel, Garrik's navigational systems indicated one path leading towards the mountain from where the laser had originated, the other towards a collapsed section. His mining instincts told him this collapse was no natural occurrence. Utilizing his advanced personal mining equipment, Garrik easily cleared the rubble, passing through the blocked tunnel. The natural cave ended abruptly at a metal door embedded in a concrete wall.

Choosing to bypass the door, Garrik mined straight through the concrete. He found himself in a rectangular corridor that led westward, the dust on the floor thinning as he progressed, indicating recent activity. The corridor ended at a staircase leading both up and down, with an elevator door to the side. The faint sounds of chatter and activity wafted from above. Garrik decided to turn back and explore the other path.

Back at the fork, he took the path leading towards the mountain. Another metal door blocked his way, but this one was covered in a thick layer of dust, suggesting it had been undisturbed for centuries. A spiral staircase ascended from this point. As Garrik climbed, he realized he was ascending the mountain itself, the exertion reminding him of his less-than-ideal physical condition.

He emerged into a vast, dust-filled control room, littered with the remnants of ancient technology. A single, still-functioning energy cell remained, wired into the central control panel. Garrik swiftly removed the cell, along with some other components, and stowed them in his bag. He then retraced his steps back to the surface.

The crash site was now a steaming lake, the lander having detonated underwater. Following a trail of footprints, Garrik stumbled upon a sprawling tent city, its inhabitants bearing a striking resemblance to the tribal warriors he had encountered earlier. The trail led him to his party, who were engaged in conversation with a human dressed in a distinct blue uniform, clearly not of Federation origin.

## The Empire's Diplomat
The stranger introduced himself as Commander Sandro Destroci, principal diplomat for the Empire of Humanity. He revealed that they had been observing the Trappist-1 system for weeks, drawn by the stellar anomalies. Destroci claimed to have deliberately downed the Valkyrie to prevent it from being completely destroyed by the planet's automated defense systems.

He further disclosed that the Empire had acquired access to the Federation's secure intranet, including the Valkyrie's crew manifest, through a Petty Officer Stephen Bang, who had traded his credentials for ship modifications. Destroci also recognized Ermine, revealing her past encounter with him on a different planet, where she had successfully persuaded them to join the Federation instead of the Empire.

Causticus, suspicious of Destroci's claims, attempted to discreetly scan him and his companions. She confirmed his identity as a high-ranking Empire diplomat and discovered records of his involvement in various peace accords with the Federation, including those with academic ties to Dr. Grace Augustine. However, she found no direct confirmation of a personal relationship between Destroci and Grace.

Chapter 3: The Valkyrie's True Mission
Destroci then dropped a bombshell: the Valkyrie's mission was not primarily diplomatic. He produced a hologram of Primus Rex, revealing it as a powerful machine of unknown function, brought on board at the behest of Fate, a mysterious cyborg recently appointed as the Federation's chief technologist. Destroci linked Fate to a biocyber epidemiologist sponsored by a shadowy organization known as the First Kings, suggesting that Primus Rex was a weapon system intended for deployment on Graft.

Ermine questioned Destroci's motives, but he insisted that the Empire's interests aligned with theirs in this instance, as they both valued the preservation of life and culture. He argued that the Federation intended to exploit the situation on Graft to test a potentially devastating weapon.

Destroci's claims were supported by the captain's cryptic orders to prioritize the collection of samples, as well as the lack of official directives to investigate the Dyson sphere or the missing starlight. Causticus, frustrated by the lack of answers, stormed out of the tent, taking Garrik and his mysterious bag with her.

## Questions and Concerns
Acolyte, concerned about the potential danger posed by Primus Rex, urged the others to listen to Destroci. He also questioned the Valkyrie's atmospheric capabilities, learning that while technically possible, it was highly risky due to the ship's antimatter drive.

Outside the tent, Causticus confronted Garrik about the device he had taken from the control room. Garrik downplayed its significance, but Causticus, using her technological skills, identified it as a powerful energy storage device with components used for beam steering. She realized it was part of the Empire's hack of the planet's laser defense system.

Back in the tent, Ermine pressed Destroci for more information, seeking concrete proof of his claims. She questioned whether the Federation could have engineered the Dyson sphere situation, but her knowledge of Federation capabilities suggested this was unlikely.

Destroci reiterated his offer to provide transport off-world for those who wished to leave, but Ermine pointed out the risks involved in colluding with the Empire. Destroci assured them that they would be treated humanely if they chose to defect.

## Causticus's Discovery
The group decided to take time to discuss their options. Grace questioned why the Federation would need to send a mission to Graft if their intention was simply to deploy Primus Rex. Destroci speculated that the planet's isolation and recent loss of sunlight made it an ideal testing ground for a weapon they may have already developed elsewhere.

Ermine, still seeking confirmation of Destroci's claims, tried to recall any information she might have gleaned about hidden motives within the Federation. While she found the shift in mission priorities to be suspicious, the overall chaos of the Valkyrie's mission made it difficult to discern any clear intentions.

Meanwhile, outside the tent, Causticus and Garrik examined the device further. They confirmed its role in the Empire's hack and Causticus suggested using it to locate their lander and gather more information.

## Division and Debate
The group reconvened and debated their next course of action. Causticus advocated for further investigation of the Empire's technology, while Ermine and Grace urged caution, emphasizing the risks involved. Acolyte, concerned about maintaining potential allies on the planet, opposed any interference with the Empire's systems.

The group ultimately split, with Causticus, Garrik, and Caelen deciding to investigate the Empire's technology, while Grace, Ermine, and Acolyte opted for a more diplomatic approach. As tensions rose and accusations flew, the group found themselves divided, each faction pursuing their own objectives in the face of uncertainty and mistrust.
