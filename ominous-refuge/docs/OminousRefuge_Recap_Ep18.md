# Episode 18 - A Promise Kept

## A New Body
The party burst from the enclosure, the air still crackling from the energy of Joseph's destructor. The Primus Rex device had made short work of the neutronium wall, blasting a gaping hole through which they scrambled. They fled through the alien corridors, battling their way through swarms of droids trying to herd them back to their conservation habitats. Their destination was the workshop, where a neutronium transport pod—much like the one that first brought them to this underground moon colony—had been spotted.

Reaching the workshop, they found Ulric, the diplomat Sandro, and his bodyguard Gary clambering onto a large table dominated by a 3D printer that dispensed glowing neutronium filaments. Ermine's bodyguard, Eesha, was also there, having been left behind by the others. With a triumphant shout, Ulric revealed the device he had miraculously fabricated using the alien printer. He yelled at Causticus to transfer Primus Rex’s brain into it.

The moment the transfer was complete, a different printer on another table whirred to life. It began extruding a new body, formed from flawless, pure black neutronium. It was built in the same humanoid shape as the telepresent bodies of the Colossals—like the one used by Queen Carolina—but this one was unadorned, bare, and missing a head.

As the printing finished, the headless body sprang from the table. It crossed the workshop in two silent strides, retrieved Ulric's device containing the captive brain, and placed it atop its neck. With a soft click, it locked into place. The voice of Primus Rex, mechanical and devoid of inflection, echoed through the room.

"Mobility acquired."

Just then, the hatch to the transport pod hissed open. The group rushed inside, but not before Eesha, in a shocking act of betrayal, cracked her shock baton down on Sandro’s skull. The diplomat crumpled to the floor, bleeding. Eesha then fended off a stunned Gary, who remained behind as the others piled into the pod. The vehicle lifted shakily and whizzed away.

Their hopes of escaping the moon of Vexis were short-lived. Instead of ascending to the surface, the pod retraced their path, flying back into the very enclosure they had just escaped. It brought them to an unvisited section, hovering directly over the familiar red hull of their own ship, the Valkyrie.

Primus Rex's voice sounded again over the pod's comms. "Promise unfulfilled. Objective: admin privileges."

The hatch opened once more.

## Boarding the Valkyrie
The party leaped from the pod onto the Valkyrie's hull. The cyborg Fate was nowhere to be seen, but a legion of Queen's Guard were charging down the enclosure hallway, converging on their position. In a surprising turn, the Drybridge scouts—who had been missing until now—formed a defensive line. Their leader, Tanath, had been pointing up at the ship, his resonant voice telling his people that this was one of the flying vessels of the "people from the sky," the one that had saved them all. Seeing the Queen's Guard advance, the scouts braced themselves, forming a protective barrier as the party scrambled inside the Valkyrie in search of the admin privileges needed to restore Primus Rex's emotions.

From the charging crowd, Malik, the new Queen's Guard captain, emerged and pointed directly at Joseph. A detachment of guards broke from the main force and swarmed aboard the Valkyrie in pursuit. They tackled Joseph to the ground and, from his robes, retrieved the Head Shaman's wristwatch—the very device the shaman had used to predict the moon's passage and the device Causticus had later analyzed, discovering an RFID password tag within it. With the watch secured, the guards retreated.

In the chaos of the boarding action, no one noticed Eesha snap Ulric's neck.

Led by Primus Rex, the group descended deeper into the lower decks of the Valkyrie. They passed Dr. Vanessa's office; Garrik's ex-wife, having already passed his Primus Rex device to Fate, sat drowning her sorrows in vodka. Their path continued downward, to a place none of them had ever seen before: a large, red metal door blocking the way to Fate's personal quarters. Primus Rex stopped before the barrier.

"Access denied. Calculating," the machine stated, before delivering a single, devastating kick. His neutronium-empowered strength crumpled the reinforced door like paper, granting them access to Fate's inner sanctum.

## Fate's Study
Inside, Fate’s personal study was surprisingly bare-bones for someone of her apparent high status within the Federation. Commander Ermine Lakeford began a meticulous search of the room, hoping to find some clue to Fate's true rank or purpose. With Dr. Grace Augustine's assistance, her search yielded no official documents or personal data terminals. However, opening a wardrobe revealed not clothes, but a collection of exquisitely crafted cybernetic prosthetics. Ermine, a former diplomat, recognized their quality immediately. They were incredibly expensive, custom-made augmentations, the kind only affordable by the Federation's innermost circle—the most powerful Core World politicians or their favored associates. Whoever Fate was, she was far more important than a simple administrator.

Meanwhile, Primus Rex strode to the center of the room. He punched his black neutronium fist straight through a rustic-looking desk, which exploded in a shower of wood and steel. From the splintered remains, he pulled out a small object that looked like a simple key. He brought it to the base of his neck, where the glass jar containing his brain was socketed, and held it there. Nothing happened.

"Admin privileges required to release emotional restrictions," he announced, gesturing with the key-like device. He was unable to use it himself.

Dr. Grace Augustine, who had made the original promise, stepped forward and took the key. It felt chunkier than it looked, more like a data drive. The moment she touched it, all her personal Federation-issued tech fuzzed. Her personal operating system shut down and rebooted, but when it came back online, she found herself granted Federation Emperor-level administrative oversight. The virtual space around her flooded with data, a blinding cascade of information representing every system on the Valkyrie.

As her senses adjusted, Grace sorted through the data flow and noticed two critical things. First, Primus Rex's brain glowed with a digital aura, overlaid with a large padlock symbol. She understood instantly that she could unlock it with a simple mental command, deactivating the inhibitor devices still embedded in his neural tissue.

Second, as she scanned the ship's schematics, she saw a gaping void where the antimatter core should be. All systems were rated by criticality, and the ship's power source should have been the most prominent. But there was nothing there. It was gone.

## The Syndicate's Secret
At that moment, a drunken Vanessa stumbled into the study, clutching her vodka bottle. "Garrik," she slurred, swaying in the doorway. "I tried to tell you. Fate... she has a dead woman's switch. She said if you came after her and she died, she'd detonate the Valkyrie. You shouldn't be in here! She's going to blow us all up!"

"What's the switch connected to?" Garrik demanded, kicking her away as she fell to her knees, pleading for him to save her. "There are no drives. How can she blow it up?"

"I don't know!" Vanessa sobbed. "The last time I saw her, she was tinkering down in the depths of the ship, doing something."

Vanessa's mention of Fate's crew reminded them of a loose end: Eesha. The bodyguard was nowhere to be seen. A quick scan of the ship's life-sign monitors, now accessible to Grace, confirmed the grim truth. Ulric was dead, his life sign extinguished on a deck above them. He had been the second Syndicate member. His last words had been about his "handler" finally sending instructions for the device now housing Primus Rex's brain. He wasn't alone, he had said. Now he was.

With the team looking to her for a decision, Grace focused on the digital padlock hovering over Primus Rex's consciousness. She made her choice.

With a mental command, she unlocked it. A spectacular display of rainbow-coloured light shot out from the cyborg's head as the emotional inhibitors were dispelled and powered down. His physical form seemed to relax slightly. Simultaneously, Grace’s emperor-level access cut out. Her systems rebooted once more, returning her to her previous, standard clearance level.

"Thank you," Primus Rex said, his voice now tinged with a faint, but discernible, human warmth. Throughout the Valkyrie, dormant systems began to whir to life as the ship's emergency backup power was activated. "The antimatter core has been removed. I am grateful."

"Can you help us take down Fate?" Garrik asked. "She's planning to blow us all up."

"Yes," Primus Rex replied. "It is in your interests, and in mine. If Fate were to get her cybernetic hands on me..." He trailed off, then continued with venom in his tone. "I was a Syndicate plant in the Core World R&D labs. I met Fate on an infiltration mission. I was meant to steal their highest technology. Instead, she stole half of my fucking brain."

"He's the Syndicate man," Joseph realized aloud.

"I am the third Syndicate member on board this ship," Primus Rex confirmed. He placed a heavy hand on Garrik Redstone’s shoulder, squeezing with bruising force. "We are brothers-in-arms, Garrik. You may have been foisted into the Syndicate against your will, but now you are a part of it. And you cannot leave." He then added, "Once we get out of the Trappist-1 system, we shall all become incredibly wealthy. My next priority is escape. Connection to external systems is inaccessible due to the sheer mass of neutronium between us and the surface."

"So if you leave with the info on neutronium," Ermine clarified, her voice tense, "this incredibly dangerous mineral will hit the black market and be used to make planet-killing weapons."

"Yes," Primus Rex said without hesitation. "And we shall all be fabulously wealthy. Consider this: if the Federation alone acquired neutronium, they would have a monopoly. On the black market, it is accessible to everyone. There will be incredible advances in medicine, energy, engineering."

"Let's deal with problems one at a time," Garrik said, trying to de-escalate. "Let's go find Fate."

"Negative," Primus Rex countered coldly. "The suggested course of action is immediate escape. Then, we nuke this moon from orbit."

"With all the people on it?" Ermine asked, horrified.

"Yes. Acceptable casualties," the cyborg stated. "Make no mistake. Despite my newfound freedom, the situation is still incredibly against us. We are outnumbered, in the den of aliens with technology beyond our own. There is no room to spend effort on anything other than escape."

## The Fall of Primus Rex
The line had been drawn. As Primus Rex outlined his plan to use the Colossals' own technology to escape, Garrik decided to act. He tried to subtly signal his companions, intending to grab a destructor device and eliminate the cyborg. But his movement was clumsy. Before he could even touch the weapon, a black neutronium arm snapped out and seized his wrist. With an audible crack, Primus Rex broke Garrik's arm without even turning around.

"I just wanted to kill Fate!" Garrik screamed in pain.

In that split second of distraction, Joseph Acolyte acted. He focused his psionic energy, issuing a single, powerful mental command at the cyborg: "Deactivate."

The command struck home. Primus Rex’s advanced neurology, part human and part machine, was not immune. It overloaded his systems, and he failed to resist. His body instantly powered down, freezing in place, still gripping Garrik’s shattered wrist.

He was inert, but only for a few seconds.

With Primus Rex temporarily neutralized, Ermine, holding one of the two remaining destructor devices, took aim. There was no need to roll for accuracy against a stationary target. She activated the device. A high-frequency whine shrieked through the study as a resonance wave washed over the cyborg.

His entire black neutronium body instantly and violently disintegrated, exploding into a cloud of razor-sharp shards that flew in all directions. The destructor, unable to handle the feedback from such a large mass, overloaded and exploded in Ermine's hand, searing her flesh.

The shards ripped through the room. Several of them pierced the glass jar that had been perched on the cyborg's neck, shattering it and tearing through the delicate brain tissue within. The container fell, smashing on the floor, and a puddle of green nutrient fluid and ruined grey matter spread across the deck.

The party dove for cover, narrowly avoiding the lethal shrapnel. Joseph, seeing the last vestiges of the Syndicate's grand plan lying broken on the floor, stepped forward and crushed what remained of the brain under his boot, offering a silent prayer as he did.

Their greatest asset, and their greatest threat, was gone.

## Aftermath on Vexis
The immediate danger had passed, but their situation was dire. They were stranded on Vexis. Primus Rex was the only one who knew how to operate the Colossals' printers and transport systems, their only viable means of escape.

Peeking outside the Valkyrie, Joseph saw a scene of carnage. The bodies of many Drybridge scouts lay bleeding on the ground. He saw Triss cradling the head of her father, Tanath, who was grievously wounded. The Queen's Guard were gone.

Ermine and Joseph rushed out, using their advanced med-kits and nanite injectors to treat the wounded. Their combined efforts stabilized the scouts, including Tanath, pulling him back from the brink of death.

"We've got to fucking kill Malik," Triss snarled, her eyes burning with vengeful fury. "He cut down his own countrymen for what? For what?"

Tanath, his voice weak, reached a hand toward them. "You are the people from the sky," he whispered. "Did we help you? Did I do the right thing? Did I betray my people for a good cause?"

"You led your people to the truth," Joseph assured him, just before the scout leader passed out from his injuries.

Their situation was clear. Fate had removed the Valkyrie's antimatter core and was hiding somewhere in the vast alien complex. The Queen's Guard, under the command of Malik and taking orders directly from Queen Carolina, had achieved their objective—retrieving the shaman's watch—and retreated, their ultimate goal seemingly to destroy all the Colossals except for Carolina herself.

The other Colossals, who had "conserved" them by rescuing them from Graft, remained a mystery. They seemed neutral, only restraining the party rather than attacking them. Their hope rested on a memory from the workshop: a newly printed humanoid avatar, not of the orange Queen Carolina, but one dressed in the white and gold of the 'White Colossal' that had been observing them.

With Primus Rex and the Syndicate defeated, Garrik's arm shattered but replaceable with Fate's cybernetics, a ship with no power core, and a legion of wounded alien allies, the party had a new set of priorities: find a way to escape Vexis, confront Fate, and perhaps, find salvation by reasoning with the elusive white avatar. The finale was approaching.
