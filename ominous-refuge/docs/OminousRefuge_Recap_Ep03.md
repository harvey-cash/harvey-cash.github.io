# Episode #3 - First Contact

## **Crash Landing**

The team of specialists assembled for the Trappist-1 mission successfully evacuated the Valkyrie Lander as it plummeted to the surface of the planet. 

As they touched down, Caelen, the Armorer, realized the lander had taken their equipment with it. Fortunately, they were still within walking distance. 

The specialists were relieved to find each other unscathed. Caelen began studying the landscape to plot a course to the wreckage. The nature of the terrain suggested a clear path to their destination. 

Meanwhile, Ermine, the mission's Diplomat, checked in with the rest of the team to confirm their status. She suggested contacting the Valkyrie for assistance. 

Acolyte, the Chaplain, advised against contacting the Valkyrie immediately, warning of potential hostile surveillance. He scanned the area for advanced technology but found nothing. 

In the distance, they spotted towering structures resembling skyscrapers, indicating the presence of civilization. The immediate surroundings were characterized by mossy, spongy ground and a variety of plant life. 

Garrik, the team's Miner, investigated the soil for potential sustenance, discovering insects and dry, orange moss beneath the spongy surface. He collected a few insects for later consumption. 

Grace, the mission's Anthropologist, suggested returning to the lander to retrieve their supplies and weapons. She emphasized the importance of approaching any potential survivors with caution and prioritizing diplomacy over aggression. 

Caelen inquired about the team's combat experience, highlighting the need to protect the more vulnerable members. Grace admitted to not being a combatant, but her bodyguard Jensen assured her of his capabilities. 

As they made their way towards the lander, Caelen noticed an unusual quality to the sunlight, concluding that it was artificially collimated. He shared his observation with the group, but no one else noticed anything out of the ordinary. 

## **Encountering the Locals**

The specialists eventually reached the crash site, where they witnessed a conflict between a group of humanoids and strange, spongy creatures. The humanoids were mounted on horse-like creatures and armed with bladed weapons. The spongy creatures, meanwhile, were small and agile, and they attacked with claws and acid. 

Caelen suggested helping the humanoids, but Acolyte questioned whether they should get involved. Ermine checked the ship's network for any messages from the Valkyrie and found one from Captain Douji, indicating that their mission priorities had changed. 

The new priority was to secure samples, ideally of human DNA, while avoiding detection if possible. Making contact with the locals was now the lowest priority. 

As they watched the battle unfold, one of the humanoids fell. Ermine saw this as an opportunity to secure samples and gain a defensible position. She suggested assisting the humanoids to achieve their mission goals. 

## **Joining the Fray**

The specialists debated whether to intervene in the conflict, with some favoring caution and others emphasizing the need for action. Acolyte decided to help the humanoids by using his healing abilities. He moved closer to the battle and cast a "Shield of Faith" spell on one of the humanoid riders. 

Caelen tried to sneak closer to the battle but was spotted by the creatures. Causticus, seeing that stealth was no longer an option, decided to join the fight as well. 

Garrik, despite his reluctance to fight, joined the battle and attacked one of the creatures with his mining rifle. Grace, meanwhile, used her magic to create a distraction, causing the creatures to become disoriented. 

Acolyte continued to heal the injured humanoids, while Caelen engaged the creatures in close combat. Causticus joined Caelen, finishing off a creature he had injured. 

Ermine used her plasma launcher to attack one of the larger creatures, but missed. Grace took advantage of the chaos to collect samples from the fallen creatures and humanoids. 

Acolyte used his magic to further aid the humanoids, and Jensen, Grace's bodyguard, joined the fight, taking down another creature with his plasma rifle. 

Ermine tried to attack the remaining large creature again, but missed. Grace continued to collect samples, drawing the attention of the humanoid leader, who warned her to stay away from the fallen humanoid. 

Acolyte used his magic to attack the large creature, causing it to flee. The battle was over. 

## **First Contact**

The humanoid leader, Triss, approached the specialists and demanded to know who they were and where they came from. Grace tried to explain that they were from the Federation, but Triss didn't understand. [Content is not available in the uploaded documents.]

Grace introduced herself and her team, offering friendship and communication. Triss remained suspicious but assured them they wouldn't be harmed as long as they didn't pose a threat. 

Another humanoid, Triss's father, joined the conversation and interpreted their arrival as being sent by "Lyria." He expressed relief that they weren't agents of "Vexus." 

Grace clarified that their ship was the wreckage from the heavens and that they came in peace. Triss warned them to keep their weapons sheathed and avoid using any more "glowing energy things." 

The humanoids mentioned other outlanders who had arrived before them and offered to introduce them to their kinsfolk to help with communication. 

## **Salvage and Farewell**

As the conversation ended, the specialists attempted to recover what they could from the lander before it exploded. Causticus managed to access the ship's network and download all of their private messages. 

Ermine and Acolyte were injured by flying debris while trying to salvage items from the lander. Grace managed to retrieve all of her belongings, including extra food and water for the team. 

The specialists then received individual messages from the Valkyrie, including the message from the captain:

Captain: â€œIt looks like the lander was targeted by an automated surface to air defence system. The mission continues but your priorities have changed. In order:

1. Highest priority: secure as many varied biological (human DNA) and technological samples (advanced digital systems) as possible.
2. Seek a defensible position and remain alive until we can retrieve the samples.
3. Lowest priority: Establish first contact and diplomatic relations. Negotiate ceasefire. DO NOT let this take precedence over securing samples.
