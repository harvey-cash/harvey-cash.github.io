# Episode 9 - Enlightenment

## The Federation's Anti-Alien Policy

The Valkyrie's mission to the Trappist-1 star system had encountered unforeseen difficulties. Three of the six crew were now stranded on the planet with no way to contact the Valkyrie, having fell from the Empire lander's rescue ladder.

The crew discussed the Federation's policy of eradicating alien species. They were unsure whether this was a standard policy or if the Empire had a different policy. They were also unsure why the Federation was so concerned about aliens.    

## The Crew's Capture

The crew had been captured by a group of tribal scouts. The scouts were led by Tanath and his daughter, Triss. The crew was bound and brought to a makeshift camp. The scouts were suspicious of the crew and believed that they were agents of Vexus, the evil moon god.    

Causticus, the cyborg, was able to translate the scouts' language. She explained to them that they were not agents of Vexus and that they had come to help the people of Graft. The scouts were skeptical at first, but they eventually came to believe the crew.    

The crew explained to the scouts that they had come to Graft to investigate the Dyson sphere that had been built around the star. They believed that the Dyson sphere was the cause of the vexing, the strange behavior of the planet's wildlife. The crew also explained that the queen was an alien and that she was the one who had built the Dyson sphere.    

## The Valkyrie's Attack

The Valkyrie attacked the laser mountain, destroying the ancient laser defence system. The scouts were shocked and horrified, but the crew explained that this was likely the Valkyrie clearing a path for the Empire lander.    

## Garrick's Betrayal

Garrick, the miner, revealed that he had been working for the Earth Syndicate, a criminal organization. He had been sent to Graft to find neutronium, a rare mineral that could be used to create powerful weapons. Garrick had been keeping this information from the crew, but he was forced to reveal it when he was caught in a Zone of Truth.    

The crew decided to head north, to the coordinates that Garrick had received from Ulrich. They hoped to find the Empire lander and regroup with the rest of the crew. They also hoped to find out more about the neutronium and what the Earth Syndicate was planning to do with it.
