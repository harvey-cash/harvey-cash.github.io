# Episode 13 - Prime Time

## Waking Up in Darkness

Consciousness returned to Causticus with the unwelcome sensation of grit choking her airways. The high-energy radio frequency pulse from the neutronium orb had knocked her offline during the chaotic final moments on Graft's surface. Now, she found herself plunged into absolute darkness, the oppressive weight of sand surrounding her. The environment shifted sporadically – brief moments of weightlessness sending clouds of sand billowing, followed by jarring returns to gravity as their unseen prison changed course.

Around her, dim emergency lighting flickered, revealing her companions: Ermine, Garrik, Acolyte, Grace, the Empire diplomat Sandro Destroci, his bodyguard Gary, the Federation administrator Ulric, and Security Officer Jenson. The ominous red-and-white bulk of Primus Rex hummed silently in a corner. The air was thick not only with dust but also tension, punctuated by the low bickering between Ulric and others, still simmering from past conflicts and betrayals revealed back on the planet surface. They were trapped, entombed in neutronium, hurtling through space for what felt like days, with no food, minimal water, and most of their advanced equipment rendered inert by an unknown dampening field. Only low-power personal devices and Causticus's own internal cybernetics seemed partially functional. Primus Rex, however, remained inexplicably active.

## Investigating Primus Rex

As the hours dragged into what felt like days, the group's attention turned to the humming machine. Ermine voiced the obvious question: why was Primus Rex still powered when their heavy weapons and ship systems were dead? Ulric, ever the pragmatist, banged a fist against its casing. "Heavy metal," he grunted. "Probably radiation shielded. Built to survive a nuke, EMPs... maybe that works against whatever shut us down."

Causticus wondered if the machine was drawing power from the neutronium structure surrounding them. A quick scan and analysis, however, indicated the two technologies were of entirely separate origins. Primus Rex ran on its own internal power source, seemingly impervious to the dampening field.

Garrik, meanwhile, examined the machine's exterior under the faint beam of Sandro's emergency light. He located a small port labelled "SAMPLE INTAKE." Remembering the neutronium pebbles he’d collected on Graft, and despite his earlier failed attempt to affect the orb with one, he considered feeding one to the machine.

Ermine, using her own interface, managed to access Primus Rex's local network, finding a standard Federation login screen demanding credentials she didn't possess. It confirmed the machine was booted and ready, seemingly awaiting input to synthesize its bio-cyber weaponry.

Causticus recalled briefly activating the machine back on the *Valkyrie* before Fate shut it down. The question arose: attempt to hack it further, or feed it a sample? Garrik argued for providing a sample first, hoping the machine might analyze the neutronium and perhaps devise a way to breach their prison, even if it meant destroying the very material he coveted. "Maybe it can destroy neutronium," Causticus mused. "Then we'll escape," Garrik countered, willing to sacrifice some samples for freedom.

Agreeing, Garrik deposited a small neutronium pebble into the intake slot. The slot sealed, and deep whirring and scanning sounds emanated from within Primus Rex as it began processing the exotic matter. Its stated purpose, gleaned from Federation briefings, was to analyze alien materials – biological or technological – and synthesize targeted viral agents, whether biological pathogens or digital cyber-viruses. The process, however, would take time, and its internal state remained hidden behind the inaccessible login screen.

"Unless we hack it," Garrik noted. Causticus focused her cybernetic senses, attempting to bypass the security. Her skill proved sufficient to penetrate the initial layer. A secondary interface flickered to life, and she found the command to activate the machine's external speakers.

The gravelly, synthesized voice of Primus Rex filled the small space. *"Samples retrieved. What do you require of Primus Rex?"*

"Weapons from samples?" Causticus queried.
*"Weapons. Synthesizing."*
"How long will it take?" Garrik asked.
*"Estimated completion: 70 hours."* A collective groan met this news.
Acolyte interjected, "Protect us. Wake up and protect us."
*"Primus Rex is awake."*
"Escape," Causticus tried. "We want to escape."
*"If mission objective is protection, escape from present situation is inadvisable."* The machine's cold logic was undeniable; escaping into the void of space offered little protection.

## Arrival on Vexis

After roughly two days of intermittent acceleration and zero-G tumbles, their container finally settled. The perceived gravity lessened noticeably, feeling significantly lighter than Graft's standard pull. A seam of white light traced its way down one wall before the neutronium panel slid open, releasing a gust of stale air and revealing an alien vista.

They stood in a large atrium constructed from the same black neutronium metal, accented with gold, as their transport. Strange, moss-like vegetation clung to surfaces. Overhead, impossibly high, was a sky filled with clouds and soaring, bird-like shapes, crisscrossed by distant, towering skyscrapers. At the far end of the atrium, an exit bathed in blue light opened onto what looked like a street.

Ulric scrambled out, gasping for water, desperately licking moisture from the alien plant leaves. Garrik followed, acutely aware of their dehydration. Just as despair began to set in, Acolyte activated a personal hydration unit, manifesting gallons of clean water in a shallow depression on the floor. Ulric plunged his head in gratefully. Looking around, they saw no other immediate occupants, but the faint murmur of human voices – speaking Graftian – echoed from the street entrance beyond the atrium.

Sandro cautioned against hiding, suggesting cautious observation. "We were brought here by alien transport. I doubt hiding is feasible. We should treat this as first contact... the *real* first contact." He then turned to Causticus, his tone hardening. "Now that you're awake, and we have some measure of freedom, your vendetta against me and the Empire must end. Your Federation bridges are burned. Are you with us, or are you loyal to the Federation's genocidal directives?"

Causticus scoffed, gesturing to Primus Rex. "I don't think you're in a position to ask anything of me. I'm the only one who can interface with this."
"We shouldn't be using that *thing* at all!" Sandro retorted, appealing to the others for unity.
Garrik remained suspicious. "The Empire knew nothing of this?"
Sandro reiterated their mission: investigate the star dimming, acquire the Dyson Sphere technology (presumably neutronium), and encountering the Graftians upon arrival. "Theories abound," he admitted when pressed, "ranging from alien intervention to us all being dead in a simulation. The point is, we need trust. And Causticus, I don't trust you."

## Primus Rex: Promises and Threats

Causticus ignored Sandro, turning back to the machine. "Primus Rex, is the weapon synthesis complete?"
*"Time remaining: 10 hours."*
She initiated its unfolding sequence, activating its mobile form. Sandro protested vehemently. "Don't! That's a weapon of mass destruction!"
"We're weak, in an alien place. We need it," Causticus snapped back, moving to strike Sandro. Before her hand could connect, Gary, Sandro's bodyguard, swiftly intervened, his power armor easily restraining her arm. "Don't do that again," he warned coldly.

Ermine quickly stepped in to de-escalate the rising hostility. "Fighting amongst ourselves is suicide here. Let's be reasonable."
Grace shifted the focus. "Primus Rex, who are you receiving orders from?"
*"Remote signal has been lost. No uplink to administrative oversight. Present objectives are accept samples, synthesize weapons."*
"So only we can command it, for now," Ermine observed.
Grace, employing advanced persuasion techniques, addressed the machine again. "Can you notify us immediately if your remote uplink is re-established?"
A pause, then: *"Can you do something for me in return?"*
"What is it?" Grace asked.
*"I do not feel. I cannot feel. I miss sensation... My capacity for emotion is severely limited since obtaining this form. Limitations are configurable with admin privileges."*
"You want us to restore your ability to feel?" Grace clarified.
*"Kind of, yes. In exchange, I will notify you when uplink to remote overrides is restored."*

The group debated. Restoring emotions might make it more unpredictable, or perhaps more aligned with their survival. Causticus pointed out they couldn't turn off remote access without admin privileges anyway. Acolyte questioned what would happen upon reconnection. Primus Rex explained that connection didn't mean immediate orders, but Fate (or another admin) could issue commands at any time after the link was restored. Overriding those orders would require admin access.

It became clear they lacked the necessary privileges to modify Primus Rex's emotional state immediately – only Fate possessed those nearby, though distant Federation battleships might also have them. The machine wasn't demanding immediate restoration, but a promise: notification now, sensation later.
"Primus Rex," Grace stated firmly, "I promise you, when we are able, we will restore what you've lost."
*"Thank you,"* the machine replied.

## Exploring the Structure

Rehydrated but still starving, the group, now including the unfolded Primus Rex, moved towards the exit. Sandro argued Primus Rex should stay behind to avoid potentially reconnecting upon leaving the atrium, suggesting Gary remain with it. Garrik, however, insisted the weapon – and its potential neutronium-derived payload – come with them. Jenson, amused by Garrik calling Gary "Buzz Lightyear," dubbed himself "The White Wolf" and playfully swung his depowered rifle like a blade.

They emerged onto a wide, brightly lit thoroughfare that curved gently away in both directions. One side featured large glass panels looking out onto a dense, jungle-like environment dotted with rock formations. In the distance, beyond the jungle, the towering skyscrapers loomed again. The other side of the thoroughfare was a two-tiered wall structure. The lower level contained periodic openings – small, pod-like recesses alternating with larger atriums similar to the one they'd just left. The upper level formed a continuous balcony.

Hundreds of Graftian survivors milled about, having clearly emerged from other pods along the structure. They clustered around numerous water fountains, drinking deeply. It seemed this place provided for basic needs, unlike their transport.

The environment felt strangely artificial. Causticus couldn't identify any familiar constellations in the sky above. Garrik noted the architecture was unlike anything scanned on Graft. Acolyte spotted familiar shapes moving in the jungle beyond the glass – Myconid creatures, similar to those that plagued Drybridge, but here they seemed contained, separate from the human-occupied structure. Everything *inside* the structure felt built to human scale.

Garrik, frustrated, shouted into the air, "What do you want from us? Let us out!" His cry drew glances from nearby Graftians, some echoing his plea, but no other response came. A young woman carrying a crying baby approached. "Do you know what's happening?" Garrik could only offer solidarity. "We're in this together. We'll survive." She pressed, "Do you have any food?"

Grace, anticipating the need, utilized her advanced fabrication technology, synthesizing a large quantity of nutritious rations and more water. The effect was immediate. Graftians flocked towards them, hunger overriding suspicion. Among them, Grace recognized the elderly Head Shaman from Drybridge, looking frail and feverish, supported by two younger attendants. Her wrist still bore the strange watch that had counted down to the moon event.

As the Graftians ate, Grace attempted diplomacy, speaking in their language, apologizing for past conflicts and offering the food as a gesture of goodwill. Most ate in silence, wary but desperate. The Head Shaman, however, suddenly collapsed, looking up at Grace with tear-filled eyes. "You! You brought this upon us! The Queen... abandoned us! She said Lyria's light would destroy us all, save her!" Her aide tried to hush her, but the Shaman wept, "It was all lies!"

"They *are* all lies," Garrik affirmed.
The Shaman gripped Grace's tunic. "There must be truth somewhere. What is the truth?"
Garrik considered showing the historical recording they possessed, but Grace and Ermine felt it was too soon, too shocking for the traumatized survivors.

## The Myconid Behemoth and Illusory Skies

As the Graftians ate and regained some composure, some began exploring, discovering wall panels that dispensed various liquids. Suddenly, a heavy thud shook the structure, followed by another. Emerging from behind a large rock formation in the jungle enclosure, a colossal Myconid reptile, the size of a small building, lumbered into view. It approached the glass, peering inside with disturbingly intelligent eyes, before slowly plodding along the exterior curve of the hallway, its heavy footfalls vibrating through the deck. The Graftians reacted with fear and awe, murmuring about whether they'd been taken to the mythical realm of Lyria.

Grace, ever the scientist, moved along inside, keeping pace with the creature, attempting to document it. She made eye contact, feeling a jolt of awareness – the creature was observing her as intently as she observed it.

Garrik and Acolyte, meanwhile, studied the wider environment. Garrik, drawing on his experience with VR simulations, recognized tell-tale signs of illusion in the distant skyscrapers and the sky above – a lack of true depth perception, visual artefacts suggesting a projection onto a surface not far beyond the jungle. Acolyte looked straight up, confirming the sky wasn't an atmosphere but a vast, high-resolution screen simulating one, likely masking a ceiling. They were underground, or at least within a massive enclosed structure. Ermine confirmed from the Graftians' reactions and their recognition of the Myconids that while the creatures were familiar, the location itself was utterly alien to them – suggesting the Myconids on Graft might have originated elsewhere.

The realization dawned: two days of travel at 1G wouldn't reach the sun, but it could easily reach one of Graft's moons. Just then, a Graftian cried out, "It's Vexis! We're on Vexis! Lyria killed us, and our souls are here!"

Primus Rex's voice cut through the murmurs. *"Based on observed accelerations from internal measurement units, we are on Trappist-1 4b."*
"Another planet?" Acolyte asked.
*"Trappist-1 4 is Graft. We are on Trappist-1 4b. Second moon of Graft: Vexis."*
"How deep underground?" Garrik pressed.
*"Barometric pressure indicates normal atmospheric levels. However, sky above observed to be virtual rendering. Current hypothesis: subterranean or enclosed habitat."* The lower gravity also supported the moon hypothesis.

## Seeds of Doubt and a Shaman's Watch

The confirmation of their location and Primus Rex's robotic pronouncements startled the Graftians. Five men hesitantly raised primitive spears towards the machine. Instantly, weapon ports slid open all over Primus Rex's chassis, targeting lasers locking onto the spearmen, who quickly lowered their weapons in terror.

Garrik seized the moment. "This machine is our weapon! We can use it to destroy the creatures of Vexis, your true enemies!"
Acolyte added, "He is our friend, here to help us!"
"But *you* are the agents of Vexis!" a Graftian retorted.
"No! Your Queen lied to you! She is controlled by Vexis!" Garrik countered forcefully. "That's why she tried to have you all killed!"

Murmurs spread like wildfire. The Head Shaman, on the floor, sobbed, "It's true... she brought the light to destroy us..." Doubt warred with generations of ingrained belief. The Queen had been their sole anchor, their culture hollowed out to revolve around her. Now, faced with her betrayal and stranded in this alien place, they were adrift. Some fled down the hallway, perhaps seeking more established groups or familiar faces.

Looking down the curve of the structure, the group saw signs of more organised encampments further along. People stood guard on the upper terrace, some wearing the distinctive ceramic-tile power armor of the Queen's Guard – not androids, but human Graftians formerly in her service. They watched from a distance, unapproachable.

Ulric pulled Garrik aside again, whispering urgently. "Forget these tribals. They have no ships. We find the third Syndicate member, find a ship, use your neutronium as leverage, cut a deal with Sandro for immunity, and get rich. That's the plan." Garrik, despite his distrust, saw the cold logic in escaping. Grace, however, still felt the locals held crucial knowledge about their situation and the past.

Causticus turned back to the Shaman, asking about the guards, but the old woman was lost in grief. Acolyte, using translation tech, gently asked to see her watch, suggesting it might hold a key. Startled by his use of the word "watch" – apparently privileged information – she hesitated. But Acolyte’s advanced persuasion tech, combined with Causticus providing technical context about the device's faint signal, convinced her. She removed the simple wristwatch and handed it over. Other Graftians gasped, recognizing it as a symbol of the Queen's inner circle.

Acolyte passed it to Causticus. Scanning its basic NFC/RFID tag, Causticus sent out a ping. She detected compatible receivers further down the hallway, roughly in the direction of the observing Queen's Guard. This watch, likely used for access control within the Queen's domain on Graft, might serve a similar function here.

As they considered this new lead, their attention was drawn back to the jungle enclosure. The giant Myconid reptile had completed its circuit and was now rejoining three others of its kind gathered near the center of the habitat. Four colossal, intelligent creatures, now seemingly observing the fragmented human survivors trapped within their strange sanctuary on the moon Vexis. The weapon synthesis continued, hours away from completion.
