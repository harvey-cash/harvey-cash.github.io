# Episode 16 - Image, Scan, Transmit, Destruct

## Unease on the Mezzanine

The tension on the mezzanine level of the Vexis enclosure was palpable. Garrik Redstone, Joseph Acolyte, Causticus, and Security Officer Jenson stood surrounded by wary Queensguard from Drybridge, their resentment barely concealed. Their captain, Malik, had just relayed Queen Carolina's demands via earpiece: aid them in destroying the other Myconid avatars – the colossal, dinosaur-like beings visible through the viewing ports – which she claimed represented Vexus and treachery, while her own orange avatar embodied Lyria and light. Standing awkwardly nearby was Vanessa, Garrik's ex-wife, ostensibly sent by the administrative leader Fate to liaise with the locals but clearly entangled in some negotiation with Malik when the group arrived.

Nearby, the imposing form of Primus Rex continued its calculations. The cyborg, containing a fragment of Neutronium provided by Garrik, was synthesizing countermeasures against the enigmatic builders of this place. He had promised a warning before Fate, currently somewhere else in the vast structure, inevitably re-established remote command oversight. The countdown timer projected by Primus Rex indicated only ten minutes remained until synthesis completion.

Garrik, wary of their precarious position and the Queensguard's hostility, suggested they wait out the final minutes of Primus Rex’s synthesis before making any decisions regarding Malik's offer of alliance.

## A Private Plea

Pulling his immediate companions – Joseph and Causticus – aside for a hushed conference, Garrik expressed his deep mistrust of Queen Carolina, who had only ever sought their destruction. Joseph bluntly agreed, suggesting they should eliminate the Queensguard. Causticus pointed out their lack of conventional weaponry and the uncertainty surrounding Primus Rex, especially with Fate potentially moments away from regaining control. Vanessa, overhearing, insisted Fate was kilometers away at the other end of the semi-circular structure, having arrived aboard the *Valkyrie*.

Suddenly, Vanessa grabbed Garrik's arm, pulling him down the stairs away from the others. She whispered urgently, insisting they *must* align with Fate. She argued that Garrik, a miner, and herself, a doctor, were out of their depth compared to Fate's high position within the Federation. Any past transgressions could likely be erased by Fate's influence, but only if they remained firmly on her side upon returning home. She dismissed Garrik’s attempt to distance himself, reminding him sharply of potential shared responsibilities back in Federation space – perhaps even adoption papers signed in a drunken stupor on Acheron, tying them together.

More critically, she revealed Fate possessed a dead-person switch linked to the *Valkyrie’s* antimatter core. Though much of the ship was depowered upon arrival here, the core remained stable thanks to shielding. If Fate were to die, the core would detonate. Garrik, assessing Vanessa's words and recalling Fate's demonstrated ruthlessness (like targeting Ermine's position with an orbital strike back on Graft), concluded the threat was terrifyingly real.

Rejoining the others, Garrik conveyed the grim necessity: they had to play along with Fate, for now. Causticus agreed, acknowledging their limited options.

## Countermeasures Synthesized

Precisely as the discussion concluded, Primus Rex announced: "Synthesis complete." A tray slid out from the machine, revealing six identical, handheld devices, roughly the size of a bulky smartphone, tapering to a probe-like tip. Simultaneously, Primus Rex transmitted data to their internal augmented reality displays, explaining the devices' functions, derived from the Neutronium sample.

He explained that Neutronium's dense lattice structure absorbed most electromagnetic radiation but possessed specific frequency "gaps" – 33 Hz, 33 KHz, 33 MHz, and 33 GHz – where EM waves were re-emitted rather than absorbed. The countermeasures exploited these gaps:

1.  **Imager (Action):** By touching the device to a Neutronium barrier, the user could generate a detailed image of what lay beyond, useful for mapping, analysis, and target identification.
2.  **Scanner (Once per short rest):** Detects Neutronium concentrations within a 2-kilometer radius. Requires a successful system calibration (simulated via dice roll internally). Garrik attempted a scan, but the device merely fizzled slightly, failing to provide detailed results. He loudly declared it non-functional to any listeners.
3.  **Transmitter (Constant Passive / Action once per short rest):** Enables communication through Neutronium barriers. Immediately, their local network updated, showing Commander Ermine Lakeford, Caelen Vesir, and Dr Grace Augustine as reachable. It could also be used as a ranged (60ft) interference attack against Neutronium-based systems (like the golden Sandworms or other droids) once per short rest.
4.  **Destructor (Action once per long rest):** Destabilizes Neutronium's molecular structure via resonance feedback. Used in melee range (point-blank touch) to destroy Neutronium barriers or assets. Extremely powerful, but carries a high risk (simulated via dice roll internally) of overloading and destroying the device itself.

As they examined the devices, Primus Rex added an unsettling offer: "If you wish to target human DNA, just provide a sample." The implication of targeted biological warfare, even from a machine designed to defend humanity, was deeply disturbing. Causticus quickly gathered all six devices. Malik and Vanessa watched intently as the group pocketed the new technology. Causticus then whispered to Garrik, stressing the need to eventually betray Fate, urging caution and secrecy from Vanessa.

## Contact and Revelations from Outside

Miles away, in the hidden manufacturing areas beneath Vexis, Ermine, Caelen, and Grace suddenly found their communication links restored. Caelen immediately hailed the others. Garrik confirmed they were relatively safe, though surrounded by the hostile Queensguard ("barbarians," he muttered, earning a glare from a nearby guard).

Caelen urged them to find a secure location to talk. The enclosure group moved to an empty food distribution alcove. Caelen then recounted their experiences:

*   They had exited the main enclosure into service tunnels, discovering a verdant area mimicking Graft's environment, populated by the colossal Myconid creatures seen from the windows.
*   Following mechanical sounds, they found a manufacturing facility actively producing more of the black Neutronium transport pods like the one they arrived in – a potential escape route.
*   Most critically, they found a workshop filled with tools, benches, and design schematics suggesting advanced intelligence.
*   Their conclusion: The Myconid creatures *built* this place. Vexis wasn't just a structure; it was *their* laboratory, *their* observation facility.
*   The planet Graft (Trappist-1 4) was effectively a wildlife preserve or zoo, and the humans there (like the Drybridge refugees) were the subjects. They theorized the Myconids, after deploying the Dyson Sphere around Trappist-1, realized the environmental changes would cause the extinction of Graft's human population and created this sanctuary as a conservation effort.
*   Queen Carolina wasn't truly "undying" or a demigod; she was an incredibly sophisticated, biologically-based, remotely piloted avatar – a drone or "wildlife cam" – created by the Myconids to interact with the human subjects. The other Myconid avatars likely served similar or differing purposes.
*   They suspected Carolina had gone rogue or exceeded her parameters, perhaps attempting to wipe out the humans on Graft, prompting the other Myconids (the "scientists") to intervene and transport the remaining population (and the *Valkyrie* crew) here via the Neutronium pods to prevent total extinction.
*   The chilling implication: While the Graftians were the intended subjects of conservation, the *Valkyrie* crew were outsiders, akin to an invasive species accidentally trapped in the enclosure. Their fate, by zoo standards, might be grim.

Garrik questioned if the Myconids intended genocide. Ermine clarified they believed the opposite – conservation was the goal, but communication would be like zoo animals trying to talk to zookeepers, complicated further by the *Valkyrie* crew being the *wrong* kind of animal. Joseph asked why Carolina tried to kill them; Ermine reiterated the theory that Carolina was interfering with the conservation project, and the abduction was to save the remaining humans *from her*.

Causticus confirmed Carolina wasn't truly undead, just an advanced biological construct. The team outside confirmed the Myconids were physically present in the central jungle area. Just then, the group inside the enclosure noted the white Myconid avatar departing from the others and moving off through the jungle.

Causticus asked if the Neutronium pods offered escape and if there were enough. Caelen confirmed seeing one completed pod and another being printed. He also relayed that Ulric, Gary, and Sandro were currently examining the active printer, debating the wisdom of entering a pod mid-construction.

## The Moral Crossroads

Causticus outlined their dilemma: help Malik and the potentially rogue Carolina avatar, or oppose her? She asked if the new devices would work on the Myconid avatars. Caelen argued their priority should be escape, not destruction. Causticus worried the Myconids' control and power necessitated a pre-emptive strike, echoing Fate's likely objective.

Caelen countered, arguing against fear-driven, xenocidal reactions, reminding them of humanity's troubled history and the importance of attempting diplomacy since First Contact. Ermine agreed, emphasizing the need for understanding and the potential benefits of peaceful contact with such an advanced species.

Isha, Ermine's bodyguard who had accompanied the outer group, leaned into Ermine's communicator. She spoke haltingly but firmly: They *had* to follow Fate's orders. Fate was in charge, had the *Valkyrie*, and Primus Rex's weapons. The aliens possessed planet-destroying technology, evidenced by the attack on Graft.

Ermine asked for clarification: Had Graft actually been *destroyed*? The outer group realized they hadn't confirmed its status. Caelen and Grace decided to head towards a suspected observation deck, leaving Ermine and Isha with the others near the pod printer.

As they departed, Ermine felt a flicker of unease regarding Isha's unwavering adherence to Fate.

## Glimpse of Destruction

In the observation chamber, the view was staggering. Black Neutronium flooring seemed to merge with the void of space, revealing the planet Graft rotating below. As they watched, the damaged hemisphere swung into view – a horrific landscape of scarred magma and orbital debris, testament to the power unleashed by the Dyson Sphere laser reflected off Lyria. The moon Lyria itself glowed dimly, the Dyson Sphere's aperture edge faintly visible, its main function apparently ceased. The far side of Graft was slowly being choked by atmospheric ash.

Caelen recalled the reflective tiles seen being manufactured earlier, realizing they were likely used to weaponize Lyria's surface for the laser attack.

## Factions Form

Back in the enclosure, Vanessa pressed Garrik again, reiterating the threat of the space laser and Fate's apparent plan being the only viable path to survival. Caelen, over the comms, continued to argue against Fate's methods and untrustworthy nature. Vanessa, exasperated, spoke directly into Garrik's comm, defending Fate's focus on defending humanity against the existential threat the Myconids represented. Garrik questioned why beings with such power hadn't already destroyed them, suggesting different motivations. Caelen decried the resort to 21st-century paranoia.

Joseph, however, declared his previous mentor, Joseph Zion, a fool. Troubled by events, he now leaned towards decisive, destructive action: "Maybe we should destroy this place and learn what we can from the ruins." Garrik, influenced by his friend's shift, reluctantly agreed.

Vanessa, hearing Joseph and Garrik's apparent alignment, announced she was returning to Fate to report. She declared their debate futile and dangerous, emphasizing Fate's absolute authority. She tried once more to convince Joseph and Garrik to come with her. Joseph declined, choosing to stay with the group. Garrik hesitated but ultimately stayed as well. Vanessa departed alone.

Garrik then suggested a new, drastic course: eliminate Fate herself before she could enact planetary or species-wide destruction. Ermine, however, proposed exploring a path of deterrence, suggesting Primus Rex's potential to analyze and perhaps replicate the Myconids' weapon technology could lead to a mutually assured destruction scenario, forcing negotiation.

As they debated, Garrik noticed something – or rather, *failed* to notice something. Vanessa had disappeared around the bend.

## The Breakout

Meanwhile, the group outside the enclosure (Ermine, Caelen, Grace) stealthily avoided the white Myconid avatar as it stomped past them and entered the workshop where Isha, Ulric, Sandro, and Gary remained near the pod printer. This cleared the path back towards the main enclosure or to other unexplored chambers. They decided to gather more information before attempting rendezvous.

Simultaneously, the group inside the enclosure (Garrik, Joseph, Causticus, Jenson) decided their best option was to escape and join the others near the Neutronium pods. Leaving Primus Rex behind seemed necessary if they used the narrow service hatches Caelen's group had used. However, Joseph pointed out they could potentially blast a hole through the main Neutronium wall using a Destructor device, allowing them to bring the multi-ton Primus Rex along.

They moved to the nearest point on the enclosure's outer wall. Joseph volunteered to use his device. Placing the probe against the Neutronium plate, he activated the Destructor function. The device whined, escalating in frequency until the wall section began to visibly vibrate and ring loudly. Then, with a burst of energy, the targeted section dissolved outwards in a spray of black filament and pebbles, blasting Joseph back. A human-sized hole opened in the wall.

Instantly, alarms blared. Red emergency lights activated. The virtual sky ceiling display vanished. And Primus Rex uttered two chilling phrases: "Uplink re-established. Administration oversight re-established." Then, looking directly at the nearby group, he seemed to plead, "Remember me?" before his systems abruptly powered down. Fate had regained control.

## Desperate Measures

They were trapped between the deactivated Primus Rex and the newly opened escape route, with the sounds of approaching enemies echoing. Garrik realized leaving the potent weapon synthesis platform for Fate was too dangerous. He and Causticus quickly examined the inert machine. Leveraging her prior study of its systems, Causticus located a surprisingly vulnerable access point near the biological processing unit. A hatch slid open, revealing a container filled with greenish brine, housing half a human brain networked with countless cables – Primus Rex's core consciousness. Causticus carefully lifted the jar out by its handle and secured it in her pack.

Just as they finished, the scuttling sounds intensified. Golden Neutronium Sandworms swarmed into view along the walls and ceiling, converging on their position. The group scrambled through the hole they'd created, leaving Primus Rex's massive, inert body behind.

## Convergence Under Threat

Looking down the long service corridor outside the enclosure, they saw Ermine, Caelen, and Grace about a kilometer away, having emerged from the observatory area. Eye contact was made across the distance.

But the reunion was fraught with immediate peril. The enclosure group heard the Sandworms massing behind them. The outer group heard the heavy thudding footsteps of the white Myconid avatar emerging from the workshop, potentially heading their way.

And Garrik, reaching instinctively for the countermeasure device he thought was safely pocketed, found nothing. His perception check failure earlier now made sense. Vanessa hadn't just left; she had lifted his device during their close conversation. They were down to four countermeasures, with the fifth now heading towards Fate. The two groups were reunited in the same corridor, but separated by distance and surrounded by imminent, deadly threats.
