## [Summary #0 - Chaos on Acheron](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep00)

Amidst the chaos of Acheron Station in 3310, the crew of the *Valkyrie* gathered for a high-stakes, urgent mission to the mysterious Trappist-1 system. Diplomat Ermine Lakeford and her assistant Eesha arrived to find a disorganized crew manifest and were immediately tasked with vetting personnel, starting with selecting one miner from three candidates. Simultaneously, cyborg technician Causticus encountered the enigmatic Fate and a dormant machine, Primus Rex, gaining high-level ship access, while architect Caelen supervised drone loading and met the eccentric armorer Stephen. Other hopefuls, like the drunken miner Garrik Redstone (accompanied by his companion Vanessa) and the zealous Acolyte, attempted to secure passage through bluffing and faith respectively.

The precarious situation rapidly deteriorated when desperate civilians, stranded on the station by Federation bureaucracy, breached the hangar doors just as the mission's anthropologist, Dr. Grace Augustine, arrived and was swept inside with them. In the ensuing pandemonium, station security opened fire, tragically killing the miner Ermine had selected. Garrik seized the opportunity to board with Vanessa, while Causticus rescued Grace. Caelen, urged on by Stephen, fired a weapon into the crowd. Amidst the scramble, Acolyte and a last-minute arrival in power armor also made it onto the ship before it sealed its doors.

The *Valkyrie* successfully detached and escaped into space, leaving the hangar chaos behind but carrying significant internal conflict. Ermine immediately ordered aid requested for the stranded civilians, while Causticus reported the unauthorized passengers (Garrik, Vanessa, Acolyte) and Caelen's lethal actions. Accusations, denials (particularly from Stephen regarding Caelen's shot), attempts at pacification by Acolyte, and Garrik's deflections marked the tense atmosphere. With a mix of official crew, stowaways, deep secrets, and brewing hostilities, the *Valkyrie* set course for the Jump Gate and the unknown dangers of Trappist-1.

## [Summary #1 - Acheron Aftermath](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep01)

The *Valkyrie*'s chaotic launch from Acheron Station leaves the crew and several unexpected passengers disoriented by the ship's vertical design and the sudden onset of 1G acceleration. Captain Zhan Douji prioritizes reaching the jump gate, postponing explanations. Officer Ermine Lakeford begins processing the newcomers: miner Garrik Redstone and his unconscious partner Vanessa (listed as the ship's medic) are directed to the Captain, while Acolyte Joseph negotiates probationary passage based on his counseling and healing skills, despite Administrator Ulric's skepticism. Attention then turns to Architect Caelen and Armorer Stephen, who fired on protestors during the departure.

As the investigation into the shooting begins, Caelen claims he acted under Stephen's guidance and perceived authorization, while Stephen attempts to deflect blame before fleeing. The Captain initiates a high-G burn (5Gs) to make up time, pinning everyone to acceleration couches for hours. During this period, Ermine files reports, investigates personnel files (finding Stephen problematic and Caelen inexperienced but proficient with weapons), recommends Stephen's punishment and Caelen's appointment as acting armorer under supervision, and formally adds Garrik and Vanessa to the crew manifest. Caelen reflects on being manipulated, Grace notices suspicious surveillance, Garrik observes censored news reports about the shooting, and Joseph arranges a secret meeting with an anonymous crew member interested in the Path.

Arriving at the Acheron Jump Gate, the visibly exhausted Captain Douji addresses the assembled crew, emphasizing strict adherence to protocol. Declaring the need to make an example regarding the departure incident, she confronts Stephen. Despite conflicting accounts and holographic evidence showing Stephen guiding Caelen's hand on the weapon but leaving the exact trigger-pull ambiguous, Douji personally drags Stephen to an airlock and ejects him into the vacuum. The crew watches in horror as his body is graphically distorted and destroyed by the jump gate's warp field. Douji then appoints Caelen as the acting armorer and orders preparations for the jump.

## [Summary #2 - Arrival in Trappist-1](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep02)

The Valkyrie crew arrived at the Trappist-1 system and were met with several surprises.  Causticus discovered the advanced cyborg Primus Rex, but was warned by Fate to leave it alone. Caelen, the new armorer, found hidden weapons in Stephen's quarters. Acolyte, the chaplain, was tasked by the Captain to identify disloyal crew members. Garrik's wife Vanessa dumped him, and he was warned by Ulric to focus on his mining duties. Grace had a suspicious encounter with Jensen, who requested a meeting on the planet.

Sensor readings revealed anomalies: a larger-than-expected star and hollow moons, suggesting advanced technology. The Captain ordered a landing party consisting of Grace, Causticus, Acolyte, Caelen, Garrik, Ermine, and the vigilante security officer Jenson. 

As the lander descended, it was struck by a laser and crashed, forcing the crew to eject.

## [Summary #3 - First Contact](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep03)

The specialists crash-landed on the mysterious planet, their Valkyrie lander plummeting to the surface with all their equipment.  Fortunately, they were unharmed and within walking distance of the wreckage.  As they navigated the spongy terrain, they discovered signs of civilization – towering structures in the distance.

Their mission priorities suddenly shifted: secure human DNA samples and avoid detection.  They stumbled upon a battle between humanoid riders and strange, spongy creatures.  Despite their orders, compassion and a desire to gain a tactical advantage led them to intervene.

Acolyte, the Chaplain, healed the humanoids with his magic, while Caelen, the Armorer, and Causticus, the Cyborg Tactician, charged into the fray.  Garrik, the Miner, reluctantly joined the fight with his mining rifle, and Grace, the Anthropologist, used her technology to disorient the creatures while discreetly collecting samples.

The battle ended with Acolyte scaring off the last creature with his technology.  The humanoid leader, Triss, was wary but allowed them to accompany her people.  They learned of other "outlanders" and a potential conflict between two factions or entities called "Lyria" and "Vexus."

A final dash to the exploding lander allowed them to salvage some items, though Ermine and Acolyte suffered injuries.  With new intel and a precarious alliance formed, the specialists received individual messages from the Valkyrie, hinting at further intrigue to come.

## [Summary #4 - Drybridge](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep04)

Grace, the team's xenoanthropologist, stepped forward and spoke with the leaders Triss and Tanath, surprisingly fluent in the local tongue.  She made initial contact, establishing them as a 'tribe from the sky', but her secretive air immediately sowed discord among the team from the Valkyrie.

As they journeyed with the tribal scouts, Triss and Tanath, towards the settlement of Drybridge, the team was struck by the absence of the planet's moons, Lyria and Vexis.  Caelen, ever-observant, realized they were still there, shrouded in darkness, a chilling echo of the 'Great Vexing' Tanath described - an event 80 years prior that brought about the curse of night time and disrupted the behaviour of the local fauna.

Suspicions about Grace grew.  Ermine and Causticus, delving into her background, uncovered a simmering resentment towards the Federation for absorbing her homeworld.  Meanwhile, Caelen, haunted by a past tragedy, confronted Jensen, the team's security officer, about his volatile nature, only to be met with open hostility.

Drybridge proved to be a stark settlement nestled against a colossal, ancient wall that stretched across the horizon.  The air, thick with the smell of salt, hinted at its purpose – a dam holding back a vast, unseen ocean.  The team languished, their pleas for an audience with the settlement's leaders met with endless delays. Frustration mounted, and the team, led by the ever-impatient Causticus, decided to take matters into their own hands.

The market of Drybridge buzzed with activity, a stark contrast to the austere warriors and the desolate landscape.  Causticus, ever the pragmatist, bartered parts of her cybernetic armor for local clothing, while Grace, under the watchful eyes of Acolyte and Causticus, attempted a clandestine meeting.  Cornered, she admitted to having a secret agenda, but said that she was not yet ready to be fully transparent about it, further deepening the rift within the team.

Just as tensions reached their peak, a figure emerged from the shadows, praising Jensen for his loyalty and chiding the team for their distrust of Grace.  He offered a path forward, a chance for true diplomacy.  His face, familiar yet unexpected, that left Ermine visibly speechless, her eyes wide with shock.

## [Summary #5 - Meet the Empire](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep05)

After a battle at their crashed lander, the away team splits up. Garrik investigates a cave system, searching for a rare mineral. He discovers a hidden, ancient control room for the planet's laser defense system and takes a power cell. He rejoins the group just as they encounter an Empire diplomat, Sandro Destroci.

Destroci reveals that the Empire downed their ship to save them from the lasers, which they had hacked. He claims the Federation's mission is not diplomatic, but to deploy a bioweapon called Primus Rex, created by the mysterious Fate. He offers them the choice to return to the Federation, defect to the Empire, or cooperate with the Empire on Graft.

Causticus is suspicious and leaves with Garrik to investigate the stolen power cell. She discovers it is part of the Empire's hack. Meanwhile, the others debate Destroci's claims and the Federation's motives.

The group splits again: Causticus, Garrik, and Caelen want to find the Empire lander and learn more about their technology, while Grace, Ermine, and Acolyte prioritize diplomacy and meeting with the Graft Queen. Tensions rise as they disagree on how to proceed, with accusations of spying and betrayal.

Ultimately, the away team is divided, with one group heading deeper into the planet to investigate the Empire's technology, and the other remaining in the tribal settlement to pursue diplomatic options.

## [Summary #6 - The Wall](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep06)

The diplomatic party attended a sermon led by the Basin Clan's shamans, hoping to gain cultural insights.  The sermon emphasized the tribe's struggle against the 'vexing' of their world, but omitted any mention of the outsiders' arrival. 

The party's attempt to approach the shaman was intercepted by the Queen's Guard.  With the scout's assistance, they reached the wall separating the city from the beyond.  The shaman demanded their purpose, and the party claimed to possess vital information for the Queen.  The situation escalated, but the shaman retreated inside the wall. 

The Queen's Guard arrested the party, taking them to a prison cell.  They considered their next move, deciding to use their technological abilities to influence the guards.  Their combined command compelled a guard to unlock their cell. 

They discovered Jensen and Gary in another cell, but prioritized their mission and continued towards the wall.  The guard led them to a staircase, and they used their technology to influence him once more.  They successfully commanded the guard to leave and entered an elevator. 

The elevator opened to reveal Queen Caroline the Undying.  The Queen, surprised, demanded their identity.  Grace prostrated herself, a gesture that intrigued the Queen.  The Queen scanned the party, identifying their origins.  They cautiously revealed their limited presence in the system. 

Grace explained their diplomatic mission, emphasizing their concern about the lack of starlight.  The Queen pondered the question, then responded, revealing her awareness of humanity outside Trappist-1.  Ermine noticed the Queen's detachment from humanity. 

The elevator doors opened to reveal an angry Queen's Guard leader and androids.  The Queen raised her hand, revealing weapons attachments, and declared that the party must not report back to anyone outside the system.

## [Summary #7 - Second Contact](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep07)

The Valkyrie's landing crew, stranded on Trappist-1 4, ascended to a mountaintop facility where they discovered the Empire's comms officer, Indigo March, fatally wounded by the native Myconids.  Using her equipment, they established contact with the Valkyrie and learned the mission's true objective: to determine whether the disappearance of Trappist-1's starlight is due to an advanced alien civilization. If so, Fate and her mysterious Primus Rex machine intend to synthesise viral infections to wipeout the aliens before they can threaten humanity’s presence in the rest of the galaxy. Captain Douji decided to bring the Valkyrie down to the planet despite the risks involved, urging the crew to locate the Empire's lander in the meantime.

Following coordinates from Indigo's communicator, the team found themselves in an underground facility where they rescued Jensen. They then confronted the queen in a throne room battle, ultimately defeating her forces and forcing her to flee.

## [Summary #8 - On the Run](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep08)

The session began with the escape from the Queen's palace after a failed attempt to resolve the situation peacefully.

The group's attempt to contact the Valkyrie was complicated by the presence of the Empire diplomat, Sandro Destroci, and the need to rescue Gary, who was still held captive.

The escape was further complicated by the corrosive nature of the samples collected from the golden androids, which damaged Garrik's rifle.

The group was forced to flee through the cave system as the Queen's guards pursued them.

The group then decided to climb the laser mountain to reach the Empire lander, hindered by exhaustion and the increasing presence of hostile creatures.

Upon reaching the top, they discovered the corpse of Indigo March and were forced to make a hasty escape using the lander.

During the escape, Ermine, Garrik, and Causticus fell from the ladder and were left behind as the lander ascended.

## [Summary #9 - Enlightenment](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep09)

The Valkyrie's mission to Trappist-1 had encountered unforeseen difficulties, leading to Ermine, Garrick, and Causticus being separated and stranded on the planet. 

The crew discussed the Federation's policy of eradicating alien species and questioned why the Federation was so concerned about aliens.  The crew had been captured by a group of tribal scouts, who were suspicious of them and believed they were agents of Vexus, the evil moon god.  Causticus, the cyborg, translated the scouts' language and explained they were not agents of Vexus.  The crew explained they had come to investigate the Dyson sphere, which they believed was causing the vexing, and that the queen was an alien who had built the Dyson sphere.  The Valkyrie attacked the laser mountain, destroying the ancient technology.  Garrick revealed he had been working for the Earth Syndicate, a criminal organization, and was sent to Graft to find neutronium.  The crew decided to head north to the coordinates Garrick received, hoping to find the Empire lander and regroup with the rest of the crew.  They were now on their own, facing a powerful enemy and unsure who to trust.

## [Summary #10 - The Cavalry](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep10)

After being rescued by an Empire lander, Caelen, Acolyte, and Grace were sedated and taken to the ship.  They awoke in the airlock and had a tense conversation with the Empire crew, revealing the Empire's involvement in hacking the laser and their orders to deliver the survivors to the Valkyrie.  The survivors discussed the lack of samples and the need to collect them.  Grace expressed interest in learning more about the Empire's mission and inquired about Sandro's whereabouts.  Acolyte appealed to Gabriel's emotions, leading to a discussion about the mission and the fate of Indigo March.    

Caelen appealed to Gabriel's sense of camaraderie, leading to a reveal of the Empire's true mission. 

The Valkyrie appeared and began docking with the lander.  The survivors were escorted back to the ship, while Fate and Primus Rex remained behind to requisition the lander.  The survivors were taken to the conference room, where they were questioned by Ulric and Fate about the aliens and the samples.  Fate, using her advanced technology, reviewed the survivors' body cam footage and discovered Grace's clandestine meeting with an unknown contact.  She questioned Grace's loyalty to the Federation, prompting a defiant response.  Fate, in a show of force, launched a "rod from God" kinetic weapon from the Valkyrie, obliterating the laser mountain and potentially killing the remaining survivors on the surface.  She then ordered Grace to be taken to the brig, dismissing her scientific concerns in favor of the mission's existential goals.  Caelen and Acolyte were also taken to the brig after Fate sensed their deception.  Fate revealed that the Valkyrie was merely the advanced party and that a Federation battleship had arrived in the system.  This revelation left Caelen to ponder their next move, while Grace and Acolyte remained imprisoned and the fates of Ermine, Causticus, and Garrik remained unknown. 

## [Summary #11 - Syndication](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep11)

Aboard the Valkyrie, Caelen discovers a massive battleship's arrival and is tasked with aiding in retrofitting a lander. He instead investigates the brig, retrieving a hidden weapon, and discovers his captured companions. Simultaneously, the prisoners in the brig find a hidden shotgun and plan an escape, while overhearing that many crew members have been eliminated.

On the planet Graft, Ermine, Garrik, and Causticus encounter a mysterious black sphere and are attacked by golden, mechanical creatures emerging from the ground. Garrik discovers neutronium and tries to investigate the sphere, while the others try to fight off the constructs.

Back on the Valkyrie, Caelen tries to convince Ulric to rescue the prisoners, but Ulric refuses. Caelen then manipulates Ulric, revealing a shared connection to a secret organization. Ulric crashes the lander into the Valkyrie near the brig, causing a catastrophic breach and sucking Joseph and Grace into the vacuum of space. Caelen desperately tries to save them, while down on Graft, reinforcements arrive to aid the group against the constructs.

## [Summary #12 - The Light](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep12)

The away team, after a perilous search, encountered a massive neutronium orb that unleashed robotic worms. Meanwhile, in orbit, Caelen and company escaped the *Valkyrie* in a lander, rescuing their companions from the vacuum of space, though two Empire officers perished. Ulrich, revealing himself as a Syndicate operative, piloted the lander erratically.

Back on the surface, the away team faced both the robotic worms and an approaching hostile crowd. Caelen's lander returned, attempting to provide support, but crashed. Amidst the chaos, Queen Caroline, speaking through the orb, threatened destruction, and the moon Lyria began to emit a deadly beam.

Just as destruction seemed imminent, a black dome emerged, shielding everyone. The orb was impaled, the *Valkyrie* crashed, and the worms ceased functioning. Inside the dome, the group found themselves trapped, with Ulrich revealing more Syndicate secrets and Caelen's true allegiances coming into question. The dome then began an extended period of acceleration, before opening up into a vast, alien atrium.

## [Summary #13 - Prime Time](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep13)

Causticus and her companions awaken trapped inside a neutronium container hurtling through space after escaping Graft. Most of their advanced equipment is disabled by a dampening field, leaving them with minimal power and supplies. Only personal devices and the enigmatic machine, Primus Rex, remain functional. The group investigates Primus Rex, finding it impervious to the dampening field and running on its internal power. Garrik feeds it a collected neutronium sample, hoping it can devise an escape method. Causticus establishes limited communication, learning the machine is synthesizing a weapon from the sample (a 70-hour process) but deems escape illogical for their protection.

After approximately two days, the container arrives at its destination. The group emerges into a vast, artificially lit structure made of neutronium on Vexis, Graft's second moon. The environment has lower gravity, breathable air, alien flora, and a projected sky masking an enclosure ceiling. They find hundreds of displaced Graftian survivors. Tensions arise between Causticus and Sandro Destroci over allegiances and the deployment of Primus Rex. The machine reveals its remote command link is offline but agrees to alert them if it's restored, in exchange for Grace's promise to eventually restore its capacity for sensation.

Exploring the alien thoroughfare, they encounter more Graftians and observe colossal Myconid creatures roaming an adjacent, glassed-in jungle habitat. Grace provides synthesized food and water, attempting diplomacy. The Head Shaman from Drybridge bemoans how Queen Carolina betrayed her people, intending for them to be destroyed. Garrik tries to rally the survivors against the Queen, now suspected to be influenced by Vexis. Acolyte obtains the Shaman's unique watch; Causticus discovers it emits a signal detectable near distant Queen's Guard positions, offering a potential lead as the giant Myconids observe them and Primus Rex nears completion of its weapon synthesis.

## [Summary #14 - Reunited](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep14)

After arriving in a strange Vexian enclosure alongside displaced Graftians and hostile Queensguard, the group discovered the provided food chemically incapacitates aggressors. Caelen Vesir located a potential escape route via ceiling hatches used by food-delivery robots. Facing limited options and internal debate over using Primus Rex's capabilities or trusting the locals, the party split. Caelen, Grace, Ermine, Empire diplomat Sandro, his guard Gary, and the defecting Ulric ascended through the hazardous hatches, taking some of Garrik Redstone's Neutronium samples, while Garrik, Causticus, Joseph Acolyte, and Primus Rex remained below.

The group that ascended emerged into a vast underground cavern outside the main enclosure structure. There, they encountered Commander Ermine Lakeford's bodyguard, Eesha, who had survived the *Valkyrie*'s chaotic descent and fought off robotic assailants. Eesha provided a starkly different account of events, detailing mutiny, executions, and Ulric's confirmed betrayal aboard the ship, framing the Federation's mission as a necessary preemptive strike against an alien threat. Acknowledging Ermine's command, Eesha now awaits orders as the group cautiously heads towards the sound of distant machinery.

Meanwhile, those remaining inside the enclosure were summoned by the Queensguard to their mezzanine position. They confronted Malik, the new Guard Captain, who was communicating directly with Queen Carolina via an earpiece, and Garrik's ex-wife Vanessa. Malik proposed an uneasy alliance: help rescue the Queen by destroying the rival creature-avatars visible in the enclosure's jungle habitat. Despite deep reservations about Carolina's motives, the group tentatively agreed, influenced by the presence of the manipulative cyborg Fate nearby and the vulnerability of Primus Rex, whose powerful Neutronium-based weapon is now less than an hour from completion.

## [Summary #15 - Ominous Refuge](#OminousRefuge_Recap_Ep15)

The group ventured from their initial enclosure into a vast central hub beneath Vexis, eventually entering a colossal neutronium manufacturing facility. Inside, enormous cube-like machines floated above city-block-sized structures, 3D-printing various objects from shimmering black filaments. Notably, one machine was constructing a spherical transport pod identical to the one they arrived in, while another rapidly fabricated a humanoid figure in white robes. Intrigued by the potential escape vehicle, Sandro, Ulric, and Gary moved towards the pod being printed, prompting the others – Caelen, Ermine, Grace, and Eesha – to follow cautiously.

Reaching an upper level via climbing, they gained a clearer view. The transport pod neared completion, printed by a machine suspended from a mechanical arm. On another platform stood the newly printed, motionless humanoid figure resembling Queen Caroline. A giant screen displayed Caroline's image, while other workstations were revealed to be printing facility components and additional humanoid avatars mirroring the colour schemes of the giant 'Keeper' creatures previously encountered (green and purple). Eesha reiterated her mission from Fate: collect samples for Primus Rex to synthesize anti-alien weapons. Ermine prioritized information gathering, survival, and rescuing the others left behind, deferring any conflict over the pod. Caelen and Ermine agreed that rescuing their comrades must precede any escape attempt, focusing on finding a safe route back.

Caelen then spotted a stationary, metallic Keeper droid acting as an intelligent sentry, revealing the immense scale of the workshop was designed for these giant beings. This triggered a cascade of realizations: the Keepers are the intelligent, technologically advanced species who built this facility and likely the Trappist-1 Dyson Sphere. Graft appears to be a conservation preserve for humans, and the Vexis enclosure a sanctuary. Queen Caroline is likely a Keeper avatar who became overly invested in her role and attempted to eliminate the 'wild' human arrivals (the Valkyrie crew), prompting the other Keepers (now printing their own avatars) to intervene and relocate everyone to Vexis for safekeeping. Humanity is akin to an endangered species being managed, placing them in a precarious position, especially considering the anti-alien weapon, Primus Rex, currently with the group left behind.
