# Episode 6 - The Wall
## Stalemate
The Valkyrie's mission to Trappist-1 was a rushed affair, its crew and purpose shrouded in disarray.  The initial objective was to re-establish communication with the long-lost civilization of Trappist-1, a world steeped in mystery and rumored to be rich in heavy rare metals.  The Federation sought to restore ties, perhaps initiate trade, and subtly secure mining rights to the system's valuable resources.    

However, upon arrival, the crew discovered a stark reality. The Trappist-1 system was eerily devoid of the expected resources, its moons hollowed out and its sun enveloped in a massive Dyson sphere.  The sphere, an enigmatic megastructure, blocked all starlight from escaping the system, save for a tiny aperture that illuminated the planet Trappist-1 4.    

Amidst this confusion, the crew found themselves entangled with the Empire, another galactic power vying for control of Trappist-1.  The Empire diplomat, Sandro Destroci, accused the Federation of deploying a secret weapon known as Primus Rex, a charge that further complicated the already tense situation.    

The planet's surface presented its own set of challenges. The tribal people, the Basin Clan, seemed oblivious to the galactic power struggles surrounding their world.  Their leader, Queen Caroline the Undying, remained isolated, shielded by a layer of bureaucracy that prevented any direct contact.    

The Valkyrie crew found themselves divided, their loyalties and objectives clashing.  Some, like Garrik and Causticus, sought to exploit the situation for their gain, following rumors of hidden mines and advanced technology.  Others, led by Ermine and Grace, focused on diplomacy, hoping to navigate the bureaucratic maze and reach the elusive Queen.    

## Division
The diplomatic party, guided by the tribal scout leader Tanath, ventured deeper into Drybridge, the Basin Clan's settlement.  Their path was fraught with tension, as Security Officer Jensen's allegiance to the Empire had been exposed, leaving his true intentions uncertain.    

Ermine confronted Jensen, demanding answers about his loyalty.  Jensen defended himself, claiming to be a whistleblower, exposing the Federation's morally questionable actions.  He expressed a desire to align himself with 'morally good people,' seeking guidance from Ermine and her companions.    

The group decided to prioritize their mission, recognizing the need for unity in this unfamiliar territory.  They agreed to attend a sermon held by the Basin Clan's shamans, hoping to gain insights into their culture and find a way to reach the Queen.    

## Revelation
As they entered the town square, they were struck by the vibrant display of the Basin Clan's culture.  The square was filled with people adorned in multicolored patchworks, their native language echoing through the bustling space.  The group noticed guards at a checkpoint, seemingly assessing people's attire and demeanor rather than checking any form of identification.  This peculiar method of control, based on social cues and self-assurance, intrigued the party.    

Their attention was drawn to a shaman standing atop a plinth, proclaiming the virtues of their beliefs.  The group observed heavily armored figures surrounding the plinth, acting as security detail.  Tanath and his daughter, Triss, stood amongst the common folk, listening to the shaman's words.    

The shaman's sermon was a fervent call to faith, emphasizing the tribe's struggle against the 'vexing' of their world.  As she spoke, the clouds parted, revealing a bright moon, Lyria, bathing the square in its light.  The crowd erupted in euphoria, praising their deity.    

Acolyte, with Ermine's assistance, used his technological prowess to discern the true nature of the spectacle.  He noticed a digital watch on the shaman's wrist, counting down to the moment the moon appeared.  The heavily armored guards also wore similar devices, hinting at a deeper technological influence within the tribe's hierarchy.    

Grace, attuned to the nuances of the tribe's language and history, sensed a deliberate omission in the shaman's sermon.  The shaman made no mention of the recent arrival of outsiders, a glaring oversight that stirred unease among the crowd.    

Ermine, suspicious of the tribe's hierarchy and the existence of the Queen, attempted to glean information about her whereabouts.  However, her efforts were unsuccessful, the bustling scene obscuring any subtle clues.    

The shaman concluded her sermon, mentioning Queen Caroline in passing but offering no concrete evidence of her presence.  The party noticed Sandro and his entourage among the crowd, observing the events unfold.    

## Confrontation
The party decided to approach the shaman, hoping to gain an audience with the Queen.  Grace expressed gratitude to the shaman and the community, acknowledging their hospitality.  Her words drew the attention of everyone present, including the shaman and the heavily armored guards.    

Sandro seized the opportunity to reiterate the Empire's desire for friendship with the Basin Clan, invoking the Queen's blessing.  The shaman, however, remained unresponsive, dismissing the party and retreating towards the wall.    

The Queen's Guard moved to intercept the party, their intentions unclear.  Tanath warned against approaching the wall without permission, fearing the consequences of such a transgression.    

Grace urged Tanath to join them, seeking his support in navigating the tribe's customs.  Tanath, encouraged by his daughter, agreed to accompany the party, vouching for their peaceful intentions.    

The party, escorted by Tanath and Triss, moved through the crowd, their confidence and determination swaying the Queen's Guard to allow them passage.    

## Breakthrough
The party reached the wall, a massive structure separating the city from the vast expanse beyond.  The air was thick with the smell of salt, hinting at a long-forgotten ocean.  The shaman approached a steel door, waving her watch-like device to open the massive hatch.    

She turned to the party, demanding to know their purpose.  Acolyte declared their desire for the Queen's blessing, but the shaman scoffed, stating the Queen was far too busy for such trivial matters.    

Grace claimed to possess information vital to the safety of Drybridge, urging the shaman to reconsider.  The shaman remained unconvinced, asserting that Drybridge was safe under the Queen's guidance.    

Acolyte reminded the shaman of their intervention against the Myconids, emphasizing their goodwill.  The shaman, however, silenced Tanath's attempt to corroborate the story.    

Ermine asserted their right as envoys to speak with the Queen, but the situation escalated as the Queen's Guard surrounded the party.    

Sandro intervened, appealing to the shaman's sense of duty and warning of the consequences of defying her superiors.  The shaman, overwhelmed by the mounting pressure, retreated inside the wall.    

## Arrest
The Queen's Guard seized the party, their enhanced strength evident as they dragged them away.  Jensen and Gary, the Empire officer, were separated from the group, their protests silenced by the guards.  Tanath and Triss were also taken to an unknown location.    

The party was imprisoned, informed that Queen Caroline might grant them an audience in due time.  Grace attempted to regain the guards' attention, hinting at a grave danger, but they remained dismissive.    

The party debated their next move, considering the possibility of the Empire's warnings about a hidden threat.  They decided to use their combined technological abilities to influence the guards, hoping to secure an audience with the Queen.    

Their combined command, 'Queen audience now,' resonated through the prison, compelling one of the guards to unlock their cell.    

## Escape
The party followed the guard, uncertain of his true intentions.  They discovered that Jensen and Gary had been taken to another cell, where the guards were attempting to remove their power armor.    

Acolyte attempted to distract the guards, hoping to free Jensen and Gary, but his efforts were unsuccessful.  The party decided to prioritize their mission, following the guard towards the wall.    

The guard led them to a staircase that spiraled upwards, his command-induced stupor beginning to fade.  As he regained awareness, the party used their remaining technological prowess to influence him once more.    

Grace attempted to suggest a course of action, but the guard resisted.  Acolyte tried to spook the guard, hoping to create an opportunity for escape, but the guard remained steadfast.    

Ermine, with Sandro's help, commanded the guard to 'leave,' successfully compelling him to depart.  The party rushed into the elevator, ascending towards an unknown destination.    

## Audience
The elevator doors opened, revealing a breathtaking vista beyond the wall.  The party found themselves in the presence of Queen Caroline the Undying, her regal bearing and ornate attire a stark contrast to the tribal simplicity of Drybridge.    

The Queen, surprised by their sudden appearance, demanded to know their identity.  Grace, following her intuition, prostrated herself before the Queen, a gesture of respect that surprised the seemingly ageless ruler.    

The Queen, intrigued by their deference, used her advanced technology to scan the party, instantly identifying their origins.  She addressed them by their affiliations and inquired about their numbers and purpose.    

The party, cautious but truthful, revealed their limited presence in the system.  The Queen, observant and perceptive, noticed their hesitation and subtle cues, further confirming her suspicions.    

Grace, with Ermine's encouragement, carefully explained their diplomatic mission, emphasizing their concern for the lack of starlight emanating from the system.    

The Queen gives the question some thought, then says, “Humanity elsewhere in the galaxy noticed lack of starlight from Trappist-1 and came to check on the humanity here.” Ermine notices that she’s talking about humanity like she’s not human.    

The elevator door slides open behind the party and the now very angry Queen’s Guard leader walks in, flanked by other Queen’s guard and more golden androids. The Queen raises her hand towards the party, revealing various weapons attachments. “You must not report back to anybody outside of the system.” she declares, levelling her weapons at them.
