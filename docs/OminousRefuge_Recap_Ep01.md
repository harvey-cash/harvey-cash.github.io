# Episode #1 - Acheron Aftermath

## Aftermath and Acceleration

Aboard the newly launched *Valkyrie*, the immediate aftermath of the chaotic departure from Acheron Station settled uneasily upon the assembled crew and unexpected passengers. The ship's interior struck newcomers as peculiar; the rooms were narrow side-to-side, barely wider than a person's outstretched arms, yet disconcertingly tall, stretching upwards level after level. Desks, workstations, and control panels were mounted sideways on the walls. Officer Ermine Lakeford, familiar with Federation ship design, recognized the layout instantly. Garrik Redstone, the miner, likely did too. Architect Caelen and Dr. Grace Augustine, however, required a moment to process the strange configuration, their thoughts confirming the ship's design: it was built for vertical flight, a skyscraper intended to generate artificial gravity through constant acceleration or deceleration along its main axis. Acolyte Joseph, less versed in such matters, remained oblivious to the implications.

Their realization, or lack thereof, was abruptly punctuated. Without warning, the *Valkyrie*'s main engine roared to life. Those unprepared, like Acolyte Joseph, were violently slammed against the port-side wall as immense G-forces took hold. Perspective violently shifted; the wall became the floor. Crew members scrambled to orient themselves in the now-vertical environment, the ship a tower accelerating through space, its engine providing a constant, pressing 1G downforce.

Amidst the disorientation, Captain Zhan Douji's voice cut through the ship's internal comms, remarkably calm yet clipped with urgency. "Everybody get to your stations. Identify your team leaders, group up. We'll discuss what just happened later. We need to get to the jump gate now." The comm clicked off, leaving a charged silence broken only by the thrum of the engines. Eyes turned towards the unofficial passengers: Acolyte Joseph, Garrik Redstone and his still-unconscious partner Vanessa, and towards Caelen and the armourer Stephen, whose actions during the hangar riot were already drawing scrutiny.

## Reckoning and Regulations

Ermine Lakeford stepped forward, addressing Garrik first. "You," she stated, her tone firm but weary, "You aren't supposed to be here. But you are the only miner we have, and it's unlikely Galmenco could provide another candidate at such short notice."

Garrik, attempting a nonchalant air despite his likely hangover, gestured towards the chaos they'd escaped. "Exactly my thought process! Saw the tragedy unfolding, knew you'd need a miner. Took initiative." He then added, glancing at his still prone partner, "Could you show me to my room, please? And Vanessa's? She's the onboard medic, needs to rest."

"Ah, she's the medic?" Ermine queried, glancing at the unconscious woman.

"I'll take care of myself just fine," Vanessa mumbled weakly from the floor, clearly disoriented by the sudden acceleration.

Ermine consulted her datapad, confirming Vanessa's listed role and the lack of any other medical personnel on the manifest. The document remained worryingly incomplete. "Report to the Captain, both of you," she instructed Garrik. "Get yourselves confirmed on the manifest. If she's happy with your presence, she'll direct you. She has the final say." She then turned her attention to the robed figure. "As for you two... my friend," she began, looking at Acolyte Joseph, only for Garrik to interject.

"He's here as well! Got permission from Ulric!"

"My friend, you do not speak for me," Joseph corrected gently but firmly. "I am where I am supposed to be. I am here to offer advice to those who need it. I will not get in your way. I've brought my own provisions. I am simply here to help."

Ermine sighed. "Respectfully, Acolyte, while I have nothing against the Path, we know nothing about you or your motives. Perhaps we should arrange for you to disembark at the nearest friendly port."

The prospect seemed unlikely. They were already accelerating hard towards the jump gate, a journey expected to take hours. While the gate maintained its own station and crew, offering a potential drop-off point, it was far from guaranteed. As Joseph considered how to plead his case, Ulric, the lead Administrator in his distinctive red robes, stepped forward from where he'd been observing.

"That won't be necessary," Ulric declared smoothly, his gaze sweeping over Garrik and Joseph. "This miner vouches for the Acolyte. And as much as it displeases me to have someone of the Path aboard, imitating the perfection of the Administration's robes..." He paused, considering. "We *are* under-handed. As leader of the Administration contingent, I have privileges. I could add your name to the manifest... but 'guidance' is insufficient. Make your case. What *other* skills warrant your passage?"

Joseph straightened. "As an Acolyte, I am trained as a skilled healer... and counselor. I am available to give support, regardless of doctrine or creed. I have studied 38 different faiths and worldviews. I am here as a shoulder to listen. I have memorized the teachings of Joseph Scion, founder of the Path. I score 99.16% on the Joseph Scion Standardized Personality Replication Test. The words I offer are, with statistical confidence, those Joseph Scion himself would speak."

"At least the guy doesn't kill innocent people," Grace Augustine muttered, passing by and pointedly looking at Caelen.

"Let's tie up this agenda item first," Ulric snapped, clearly irritated by the interruption but acknowledging Grace's point. "Officer Lakeford, your rank likely equals my own – a matter I shall review with the Captain – but for now, the decision rests with you. Should this... Acolyte... stay?"

Ermine considered, rubbing her temples. "Given the circumstances... perhaps a probationary period? To see if his skills live up to his test scores."

"I encourage you to review my file," Joseph added earnestly. "You'll see a long history of providing aid. The Path has brought me here; there must be a need for me on this ship."

"We shall see," Ermine conceded. The mention of probation sent a bead of sweat down Ulric's forehead. As if summoned, another red-robed Administrator appeared.

"Federation scripture calls for a document outlining the terms and conditions of such a probationary period!" the newcomer declared officiously.

"Yes, yes, Section 39B-24A-7," Ulric waved dismissively. "Handle it. Consider it a break from your other duties." The second administrator beamed and vanished to draft the necessary paperwork. Ulric, giving Garrik a look that conveyed reluctant acceptance, turned to his next agenda item. "Sorted. Now," he pointed squarely at Caelen and where Stephen had been standing, "you two. Shooting protestors. People aren't fond of that. Make your case. I shall consult the Handbook to determine the Administration's official stance. Consider me impartial for now."

Caelen stepped forward, deferring nominally to Stephen, the ship's armorer, but speaking first. "At what point do the secondary duties to defend the ship begin? These rules of engagement are millennia old. If this had happened mid-flight, or upon landing, it would be all hands on deck. Furthermore, Commander Lakeford's last instruction, as I recall, authorized lethal force. Much as it pains me, I believe I acted within my rights, under the guidance of our ship's armorer." He gestured towards Stephen, then acknowledged his own limitations compared to seasoned fighters. "I admit, it may have been overzealous action. I hold my hands up to that."

Garrik scoffed. "Not enough being handy with a gun, mate. Got to be handy with your head."

"He *is* handy with heads," Stephen chimed in cheerfully. "Nailed that one right through the center. Perfect shot."

Ermine frowned, recalling witness accounts. "Based on observations, Caelen, you were shooting civilians not yet within range of damaging the *Valkyrie*."

"It wasn't the best tactical decision," Caelen conceded again, "but they acted with violent intent towards the ship. I acted appropriately, if prematurely. I am uncomfortable sharing a ship with crew members who visit violence upon civilians with light justification."

"With all due respect, Commander," Caelen countered, addressing Ermine, whose diplomatic rank placed her high in the ad-hoc hierarchy, "My duty assignment comes from the Federal Institute of Architecture. They sponsored my presence here. You'll need to take it up with them." Checks of Federation protocols confirmed the messy reality: the usual clear command structure hadn't been established due to the hasty departure. Ultimately, Captain Douji held authority, but the lines below her were blurred.

As the debate continued, Stephen whistled nonchalantly and began sidling towards a side door. Caelen noticed. "I also think *that* man has quite some to answer for!" he called out.

Stephen froze mid-stride, shoulders tensing, but didn't turn. "Watch your tone! I'm the ship's armorer, best remember it!"

"Is that a position of incredible responsibility?" Caelen pressed.

"I don't have to answer your questions!" Stephen retorted, his accent momentarily slipping. "And if you didn't ask any, I wouldn't have to! So I'm just gonna walk away before you can!" He then broke into a run and disappeared through the doorway.

Ermine immediately sent a message to the Captain via her datapad, recommending the armorer be placed under observation. No reply came; the Captain was clearly occupied.

## High-G and Hidden Agendas

Just then, Captain Douji's voice crackled over the comms again, sharp and strained. "Anyone who isn't strapped in, fucking sit down! Put your seatbelts on! Find a seat, *any* seat! We're going to accelerate to make up time!"

A scramble ensued as everyone rushed to find the heavy-duty acceleration couches lining the bulkheads. Grace and Caelen weren't fast enough. Before they could secure themselves, the ship lurched violently, pinning them to the deck plating as the engines ramped up from 1G to a crushing 5Gs. Both took bruising impacts. Nearby, Caelen saw Stephen grinning from a secured couch he'd apparently snatched at the last second. There was a tense moment as the Captain briefly cut the engines, allowing a few seconds of nauseating freefall for Grace and Caelen to finally strap themselves into vacant seats – Caelen ending up right beside Stephen – before the crushing acceleration resumed.

Pinned into their seats for the next several hours as the *Valkyrie* burned hard towards the jump gate, the crew turned to their personal devices and neural interfaces.

Ermine Lakeford dedicated the time to bureaucratic damage control and reporting. She fired off missives to Acheron Station command, leveraging her diplomatic standing to demand action on the stranded civilians. Her efforts yielded slow results; news feeds later showed the first small groups of protestors being processed for delayed transport home. Next, she meticulously compiled reports for the Captain: detailing the onboarding of Garrik and Vanessa, the probationary arrangement for Acolyte Joseph, and a formal account of the shooting incident involving Caelen and Stephen. Accessing personnel files, she confirmed Caelen's assessment of Stephen: a long, troubled disciplinary record across the Federation, marking him as a clear liability. Caelen's record, by contrast, was clean, though largely due to inexperience. Ermine's report recommended Stephen be demoted, his pay docked for compensation to the victim's family, and placed under Caelen's supervision. Caelen, despite his transgression, would also face a pay docking and a formal warning, but his proficiency with weapons (a surprising note in his architect's file, stemming from a family history) made him the only viable candidate to monitor, and potentially replace, Stephen as armorer. She also recommended the Captain keep a close eye on both. Finally, tackling the manifest issues, Ermine successfully navigated the ship's administrative systems, formally adding Garrik as Lead Miner and Vanessa as Ship's Doctor to the crew roster just as the *Valkyrie* began its deceleration burn. Garrik received the automated notification; Vanessa snored through hers.

Caelen, pinned beside Stephen, tried to make sense of the armorer's erratic behavior – welcoming one moment, treacherous the next. His attempts to analyze Stephen yielded little; the man seemed dangerously unpredictable, a wildcard whose presence on the mission spoke volumes about its hasty organization. Caelen reflected grimly on his own actions. Raised around weapons, he'd romanticized conflict, but the reality of his first violent encounter, instigated by Stephen's goading, left him feeling foolish and manipulated. He reviewed Stephen’s appalling public record via his own interface, realizing the man was a walking incident report. He also understood, with dawning dread, that someone *had* to be held accountable for the civilian death. It wouldn't simply be overlooked.

Grace Augustine, pretending to sort through disorganized research notes, subtly scanned her surroundings. Her attention was drawn to a man in Federation Security power armor – the same one who had performed a spectacular last-minute dive onto the ship during the chaos – staring openly at her from across the compartment. Simultaneously, her interface pinged: security personnel were actively accessing her Federation profile. She identified the staring man as Security Officer Jenson via the ship's network, felt a surge of awkwardness, and buried her face in her notes until he eventually looked away.

Garrik Redstone used the time to scour news feeds about the shooting incident. Initial reports sensationalized the event, misidentifying the slain protestor as a Galmenco employee shot by a "deranged armorer and his wayward assistant." He noticed something strange: whenever reporters seemed poised to discuss the origin of the fatal shot, the feed abruptly cut to commercials, and the topic was dropped upon return. The official narrative focused instead on praising Federation forces for expertly handling the "violent mob," while condemning the security lapse that allowed the shooting. The mission itself was barely mentioned.

Acolyte Joseph found a relatively secluded corner, arranging his few belongings and mentally preparing himself to offer support. Garrik approached him briefly. "So good you got on board, mate," the miner said quietly. "Think I'm gonna need you here. It's gonna be a tough one." He didn't elaborate, leaving Joseph slightly perplexed but reaffirming his availability. Later, an anonymous message arrived on Joseph's private comm channel: "Glad that someone from the faith made it on board. Was convinced the Captain was going to blow all you Path followers to smithereens." Intrigued, Joseph replied, suggesting a meeting. The anonymous sender agreed, expressing interest in the Path's personality tests but cautioning secrecy from the Administration. They arranged to meet in Cargo Bay 3 after the upcoming jump.

## Judgement at the Jump Gate

Hours later, the crushing deceleration ended, replaced by the disorienting silence of weightlessness as the *Valkyrie* coasted. Micro-thrusters fired, stabilizing the ship. Through the viewports, the destination dominated the starfield: the Acheron Jump Gate, a colossal ringed megastructure. At its center, spacetime itself warped, distorting the stars behind it into smeared lines – the nascent formation of a warp bubble, the gateway to faster-than-light travel.

Automated docking procedures commenced. Captain Zhan Douji summoned the entire crew – the final, official roster – to a mission briefing amphitheater. She swiveled in her command chair to face them, and the toll of the mission was starkly visible. The haggard look Ermine had glimpsed hours ago was now undeniable; exhaustion lined the Captain’s face, her hair was disheveled, her uniform slightly askew. It was clear she hadn't slept properly in days.

"Okay," she began, her voice rough. "We've arrived at the jump gate. Number of things need sorting." She addressed Ulric first, ordering him to finalize the crew manifest – they were sticking with who they had, with *one* exception. She exchanged brief, technical words with Fate regarding cyborg protocols for the absent Causticus and Primus Rex. Then, she turned to Ermine. "Received your reports, Commander Lakeford. Thank you. Slight alterations, though."

She stood, pacing slowly. "Despite the chaos surrounding our departure, you are all Federation personnel in one way or another." Her eyes lingered on Acolyte Joseph for a moment. "There is *no* tolerance for breaking protocol. No goofing off. I don't need to tell decorated officers, engineers, and scientists how to behave. Act befitting your station. Have I made myself clear?" Her gaze hardened. "To demonstrate that we are not here to fuck around, that this mission is important, we will make an example." Her voice dropped, cold and sharp. "Armorer Stephen. Make yourself known."

Stephen shuffled forward nervously. "Looking at me? Didn't fucking do nothing! It was Caelen! That crazy architect! Don't trust him, throw *him* off the ship!"

"*Throw him off the ship*," the Captain repeated, ignoring Stephen's outburst. "Ulric. Federation regulations. Punishment for disobeying a direct order regarding lethal force?"

Ulric consulted his datapad, sighing dramatically. "Ah, well, it pains me to say, it's rather archaic given modern conveniences... but technically? Airlock ejection."

"You gotta be fucking kidding me!" Stephen yelped, looking wildly around the room, eyes pleading. "Caelen! Vouch for me! You know what they're saying!"

Caelen remained silent, face impassive. "I was prepared to vouch," he said quietly, "but you clearly wanted to go this alone."

Acolyte Joseph stepped forward hesitantly. "Captain... are we truly prepared for such a brutal end? Surely there are more merciful ways... perhaps a simple bullet?"

"That would be efficient, Acolyte," the Captain conceded dismissively, "but it wouldn't make an example of blatant disregard for human life and the rules of this ship." Joseph looked down, shaking his head slowly.

Grace spoke up. "Was it Stephen who killed the innocent person, or Caelen? I was dragged onto the ship... I don't know. But if you're playing justice, do it right."

"It was a command by a superior!" Caelen interjected quickly.

Before the argument could escalate, Fate, the cybernetics specialist, intervened smoothly. "Luckily, we need not rely on human memory. We have surveillance holograms." She activated a projector, and a detailed, monochromatic 3D reconstruction of the hangar bay scene filled the center of the room – the mob, the ship, the final moments before departure. It clearly showed Stephen putting the weapon in Caelen's hands, guiding his aim, his own hand covering Caelen's on the trigger group, making the exact moment of firing ambiguous.

As the chilling scene played out, crew members focused on different aspects. Garrik scanned the periphery, searching the chaotic background for any clue about the origin of other weapon discharges reported during the riot. Ermine and Caelen watched the damning interaction between Caelen and Stephen intently. Grace, too, focused on the trigger, but her gaze drifted slightly, catching Fate's eye across the projection. The cyborg met her look with a faint, knowing smile before Grace looked away. No one else gleaned any new information from the replay; the crucial moment remained obscured, though Stephen's involvement was undeniable. Acolyte Joseph simply looked horrified by the replayed violence.

The Captain wasted no time on ambiguity. "There we have it," she declared. Striding across the room, she grabbed Stephen by his collar. Ignoring his terrified struggles and the blaring warnings of an unauthorized activation, she dragged him to the nearest airlock, cycled the doors, and ejected him forcibly into the void.

The crew watched in stunned silence as Stephen tumbled away from the *Valkyrie*, towards the shimmering distortion of the active jump gate. His body began to visibly distend in the vacuum, blood vessels bursting under internal pressure. Then, as he hit the edge of the warp field, his form horribly elongated, stretched, and smeared like paint, twisted beyond recognition by the raw forces of warped spacetime he was never meant to encounter unprotected. The look of silent horror on his face was the last discernible feature before he simply ceased to exist.

Captain Douji returned to her chair, dusting off her hands. The only sound was the faint hum of the ship and the distant thrum of the jump gate. "On the advice of Commander Lakeford," she announced into the silence, her voice flat, "Caelen is the new acting armorer." She surveyed the room, her gaze sweeping over the stunned faces. "Now, everyone, back to your posts. Prepare for jump."
