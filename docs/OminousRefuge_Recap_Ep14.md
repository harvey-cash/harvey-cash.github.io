# Episode 14 - Reunited

## Initial Options and Investigation
Following their arrival in the strange, semicircular enclosure within Vexis, the group assessed their precarious situation. Displaced Graftians milled about, wary refugees in an unknown environment. The imposing Queensguard maintained positions on a mezzanine level above, a clear potential threat. Somewhere nearby, Fate and Eesha were presumed to be held, captured by the same Vexian technology that had transported everyone from Graft. Primus Rex continued its synthesis process, utilising Garrik's collected Neutronium samples.

Causticus reviewed their immediate options. They could proceed down the main corridor, using the Head Shaman's wristwatch which seemed capable of interacting with local systems, potentially opening doors. However, this path led towards the Queensguard, risking conflict while the group remained unarmed. Alternatively, they could try to rally the displaced Graftians, building on the tentative trust established by providing food and evidence against Queen Caroline. A final option involved Dr Grace Augustine attempting communication with the large creatures visible through the enclosure's inner windows, or further investigation of their surroundings.

Caelen Vesir sought to understand their environment better. The structure curved, with the inner radius featuring large windows overlooking a simulated jungle habitat. The outer radius, where they currently stood, was studded with large atriums like the one they'd emerged from, alternating with smaller rooms. Caelen decided to investigate the structure's outermost points, hoping to find an external access hatch or determine what lay beyond.

Moving cautiously down the hallway, mindful of the Queensguard observing from the mezzanine above, Caelen peered into the next small room along the outer wall. It served as a communal area, containing water features refugees drank from and a large table, now empty but clearly intended for food distribution. Examining the far wall – constructed of black Neutronium inlaid with the familiar ornate gold alloy seen in the Queen's sandworms and droids – Caelen initially found no access panel. However, a closer look upwards revealed a faint seam indicating a hatch high in the Neutronium ceiling. As he watched, the hatch slid open, and a robotic golden arm descended, carrying a fresh tray of food. It placed the tray on the table, triggering a swarm of hungry Graftians, before retracting and sealing the hatch once more. Assessing the hatch, Caelen judged it just large enough for a person to climb through and decided to report back to the others.

## Troubling Discoveries and Difficult Decisions
As Caelen returned, Grace inquired about the Graftians' disposition. While most remained wary, having initially been warned the newcomers were "agents of Vexis," the Head Shaman and her immediate circle seemed disillusioned with their Queen after recent events. They stayed close, primarily because the group had provided safe food, but trust was fragile. Notably absent were Tanath, Triss, and the allied tribal scouts, their location unknown.

Garrik Redstone proposed a defensive measure: collecting DNA samples from the creatures outside the windows to program Primus Rex for targeted defense. Causticus countered that the Queensguard posed a more immediate threat, while Caelen voiced ethical concerns about participating in what seemed like the Federation's potentially genocidal plan to acquire samples for extermination. Causticus suggested targeting the Queensguard or Caroline herself, though acquiring their DNA would require direct confrontation, something they were ill-equipped for. Primus Rex confirmed it could process a second sample concurrently with its ongoing weapon synthesis.

As they debated, a commotion erupted further down the hall. An older Graftian man, aggressively demanding food from a younger girl, suddenly collapsed unconscious. Joseph Acolyte moved to examine him. His medical assessment indicated the man was unharmed but asleep, knocked out by a chemical agent likely ingested via the distributed food or water. It seemed everyone had consumed some, but only this man had fallen unconscious.

Observing another scuffle break out – this time between two elderly individuals arguing about finding the Queen – the group witnessed the aggressor in that conflict also collapse instantly. Ermine Lakeford hypothesised that the food or water contained an agent designed to suppress conflict by incapacitating aggressors, a form of automated order preservation. Garrik attempted to test this by feigning aggression towards Ulric, who had not consumed the Vexian provisions. The attempt provoked only confusion from Ulric; Garrik remained unaffected, suggesting the knockout effect was indeed tied to consuming the local food or water and linked to genuine aggression.

Caelen shared his discovery of the ceiling hatch and the robotic arms, proposing it as a potential escape route or a way to bypass the Queensguard. While Garrik and Joseph initially preferred waiting for Primus Rex to complete its weapon, Caelen argued against inaction. He volunteered to scout the hatch, and the Empire diplomat, Sandro Destroci, offered to accompany him. Grace agreed to join as well, hoping it might lead to a way to interact with the creatures outside.

## Neutronium Negotiations and Splitting the Party
Ulric, agitated and desperate to escape, declared he would join the scouting party, citing Sandro's guarantee of diplomatic immunity. He then pressed Garrik for some of the Neutronium samples. This sparked a tense negotiation. Ulric, revealing his Syndicate ties were still relevant, wanted the Neutronium to secure favour (and wealth) upon returning to the Empire via the Syndicate. Garrik, wary of losing his only leverage, refused. Sandro and his bodyguard, Gary Gallagher, spoke up, supporting Ulric's plan – escape the enclosure, find an orb, and take the Neutronium back to the Empire as their best chance of survival.

Ermine questioned the Empire's need for Neutronium. Sandro described it as a miracle material capable of revolutionising industry, claiming weaponisation hadn't crossed his mind, though acknowledging the potential for misuse. Garrik remained skeptical.

Reluctant to give samples directly to Ulric, Garrik proposed distributing some among the departing group members he trusted more. Ermine decided to join the exploration team after hearing the discussion. Garrik ultimately agreed to keep four Neutronium samples for himself and Causticus (who was staying behind with Primus Rex) and give two samples each to Caelen and Ermine. Grace and Joseph declined to carry any. Joseph, reconsidering the risks, decided to stay behind with Garrik and Causticus after all.

## The Ascent
Caelen proceeded to one of the food distribution rooms and waited. Soon, a hatch slid open, and a golden arm descended with a food tray. As it reached its lowest point, Caelen grabbed onto it, intending to climb. He instantly felt an electrical charge build within the arm. Reacting with surprising speed and agility, he scrambled up through the opening just before the defensive shock could incapacitate him, disappearing into the ceiling space as the arm retracted and the hatch slammed shut.

Witnessing Caelen's near-miss, the remaining explorers – Grace, Ermine, Sandro, Gary, and Ulric – realised the ascent was hazardous. They surmised the shock was likely non-lethal but incapacitating. Moving to another nearby food station, they waited for the next arm. Bolstered by Joseph's quick tactical advice and their own preparedness, Grace and Ermine managed the climb, enduring minor electrical jolts but successfully reaching the space above. Sandro, Gary, and Ulric followed, similarly managing the hazardous ascent, leaving Garrik, Causticus, Joseph, and Primus Rex below.

## Above and Beyond the Enclosure
The group found themselves in a cramped, hot space filled with the whirring machinery of an automated distribution system – a network of bots transporting food trays along tracks following the enclosure's curve. Gaps in the machinery suggested passages leading further outward, away from the jungle-view windows, and also potentially upward, over the enclosure's transparent ceiling.

Moving cautiously, they narrowly avoided detection by several golden Sandworm constructs patrolling the attic space. Assessing their options, they could follow the curve of the enclosure in the rafters, scramble inwards over the glass ceiling towards the jungle habitat, or move outwards away from the entire structure. Ermine activated a short-range sensor sweep, detecting no unusual energy signatures or life forms nearby, though the Sandworms registered as constructs.

Opting to move outwards, seeking escape, they scrambled over humming pipes and conduits. They reached what seemed like an outer wall and carefully climbed down, emerging into a vast, dimly lit cavern outside the enclosure structure. They now viewed the entire semicircular habitat – jungle, viewing windows, atriums and all – from an external perspective, like looking at a massive terrarium. The cavern floor was composed of fine, grey dust similar to lunar regolith, supported by massive Neutronium beams. The scale was immense, clearly designed for beings far larger than humans. Huge archways led off into darkness in different directions. From one direction (further outwards), they heard the rhythmic thrumming of heavy machinery. From another (leading inwards, back towards the enclosure's central jungle area), they heard the screeches and calls of unseen wildlife.

## Confrontation on the Mezzanine
Back inside the enclosure, Garrik, Causticus, and Joseph watched their companions disappear upwards. The Queensguard on the mezzanine above took notice, their posture becoming more overtly suspicious now that the group was smaller. Garrik called up, asking why they were staring, but received only silence as one guard turned and moved deeper into the terrace, presumably to report.

Moments later, the guard returned and beckoned Garrik's group upstairs. Taking some of the potentially drugged food with them as a dubious offering, the three humans ascended, accompanied by Primus Rex, who activated an intimidation protocol, rearranging its plating to appear larger and more menacing. The Graftian refugees scattered before the imposing machine.

At the top of the stairs, Queensguard soldiers, clad in their ceramic-tile power armour, parted nervously, their energy weapons visibly inactive. They stepped onto the terrace, a smaller version of the street below, also dotted with food and water stations. Guards were present, some with helmets off, consuming the provided rations.

At the centre of the makeshift encampment stood Malik, the man who had executed the previous Captain of the Guard back in Drybridge. He was speaking quietly but intently with Vanessa, Garrik's ex-wife. Vanessa saw Garrik, her eyes widening, but she quickly averted her gaze. Malik finished his conversation, and Vanessa stepped back as he approached Garrik's group.

"Finally," Malik said in halting Galactic Common, waving his guards back slightly. "The Agents of Vexis come. Just as I predicted." Garrik ignored him, trying to speak to Vanessa, asking how she survived. She remained silent, subtly moving to stand closer to Garrik's group. Joseph asked how Malik knew their language; Malik curtly replied that the Queen had personally educated him.

A quick assessment suggested Vanessa was hiding something, appearing somewhat ashamed, while Malik seemed entirely confident. Causticus noticed Malik wore an earpiece and a wristwatch identical to the one Joseph now carried from the shaman. Malik, cracking his shoulders within his humming power armour, stated, "Queen Caroline, long may she reign, informed me that you would likely be here as well. I'd like to make a deal."

Joseph activated a localized truth-compelling field. Malik, unfazed, declared, "I always speak the truth. You will never hear a lie escape from me." He confirmed he was receiving instructions from the Queen via his earpiece. He revealed he had been discussing a potential alliance with Vanessa to rescue the Queen from "her kin," who he claimed had captured her. Vanessa, prompted by Joseph, confirmed Fate was on the opposite side of the structure and had instructed her to find the "leader of the local people" (presumably Malik).

Malik explained that the Queen's kin – other powerful beings like her – were "corrupted," having idly watched Vexis plague Graft. Only Caroline had dared to intercede, and now her kin had interfered, capturing her. He gestured out the window towards the jungle habitat, where four colossal, reptilian creatures vaguely resembling myconids were visible. Three – green, white, and purple – prowled menacingly around a fourth, orange one. "Those are the avatars of the demigods," Malik explained, indicating the orange one was the Queen's defender, currently besieged by the others. "We are in their land now. Make no mistake. We are in a zoo."

He proposed an alliance: help him rescue the Queen by destroying the other three creature-avatars, and past transgressions (referring to their actions in Drybridge) would be overlooked. Garrik, Joseph, and Causticus were deeply skeptical. The Queen's defender seemed outnumbered, and siding with Caroline, who had previously tried to kill them and whose followers still labelled them "Agents of Vexis," felt wrong. Causticus argued the other three might be the actual "good guys," potentially having saved them from the Vexis disaster Caroline seemed indifferent to.

As they debated, Primus Rex announced, "Time remaining: one hour."

Joseph worried that if Fate arrived, she could instantly regain control of Primus Rex, turning their only major asset against them. Siding with Malik, however reluctantly, seemed strategically necessary for immediate survival. Garrik quietly asked Vanessa for her opinion. She whispered that Fate wanted samples of everything – implying the creatures, guards, anyone – for Primus Rex, presumably for targeted elimination. She urged returning to the Valkyrie and reuniting the crew under Fate's command.

Causticus pressed Malik about his wristwatch (access to the Queen's chambers) and his unwavering belief they were "Agents of Vexis" (the Queen's designation). Malik reiterated his belief that Caroline represented the benevolent Lyria, while the other demigods served the malevolent Vexis. He offered them a chance at "redemption" by fighting their supposed masters. When asked how the powerful Queen could need rescuing, he simply blamed "treachery." He insisted their previous encounter was merely the Queen defending her people. Seeing Malik was utterly convinced, Garrik suggested they agree to the alliance for now and asked how to get out. Malik replied his guards were currently scouting the perimeter.

## Jungle Scouting and Eesha's Revelation
Meanwhile, outside the enclosure, Caelen's group debated their next move. Caelen favoured heading towards the distant machine thrumming, while Grace felt drawn to the jungle sounds, hoping to understand the creatures. They decided to cautiously scout the jungle area first as it was slightly closer.

Jogging along the exterior of the enclosure wall, they rounded a corner and peered into the jungle region. They spotted numerous smaller myconid creatures – similar to those encountered on Graft – nesting among rock formations and fungal growths. The creatures noticed them but remained wary rather than aggressive. Far in the distance (about a kilometer away), they saw the four colossal lizard-avatars. Grace, relying on her biological knowledge, assessed that the large creatures appeared herbivorous based on their physiology, while the smaller myconids seemed omnivorous. The three surrounding lizards were roaring and posturing aggressively towards the lone orange one, which snarled back defiantly, but no physical combat had erupted yet.

Grace confirmed the purple creature she'd previously made eye contact with was among the group currently visible. Realising they could potentially be seen from the enclosure's observation deck if they ventured further, and heeding Sandro's nervousness, they decided to retreat and head towards the machine sounds instead.

Retracing their steps back around the corner, they suddenly came face-to-face with Commander Ermine Lakeford's bodyguard, Eesha, clad in intact power armour. She was furiously battling several golden androids identical to those seen in Queen Caroline's throne room, punching clean through them with her fists while others engaged her in melee. Seeing friendlies, Sandro and Gary immediately opened fire with their sidearms, and Caelen and Ermine joined the fray. The androids, lacking the apparent invulnerability of the Neutronium sandworms, were quickly disabled.

Eesha, breathing heavily, parts of broken machinery clinging to her armour, instantly recognised Ermine. "Finally!" she exclaimed, declaring the area unsafe. She abruptly hoisted Ermine over her shoulder and began sprinting towards the direction of the machine sounds, shouting for the others to follow.

While running, Eesha rapidly summarised events aboard the Valkyrie after the party's departure to Graft: Security Officer Jenson going planetside instead of her; Captain Douji and Fate executing crew members via airlock for questioning the mission; the revelation of the true objective (preemptive strike against perceived alien threats); the arrival of Empire personnel (Sandro's group) who were subsequently brigged as suspected traitors; a brig breach that vented numerous crew into space; Ulric's betrayal being uncovered; the general chaos and poor organisation of the mission; the Valkyrie finally descending to rescue the party only to be caught in the Neutronium orb deployment and separated.

Ermine, set down once they'd put distance between themselves and the encounter site, challenged Eesha's narrative, suggesting the Federation mission itself bordered on genocide. Eesha vehemently disagreed, insisting they were preventing humanity's genocide by eliminating the aliens, citing the recent near-destruction by the Dyson Sphere's focused light as proof of the threat. Ermine countered that their own presence likely triggered that event. Eesha relayed the official justification: the aliens controlled the star's output and could potentially target Federation worlds.

As the rest of the group caught up, Eesha eyed Sandro and Gary warily. Ermine explained their cooperation had been necessary for survival. Eesha recounted Fate and Douji's extreme paranoia regarding the Empire. When pressed about venting crew, Eesha defended the actions as necessary protocol under a sudden "black alert" existential threat scenario, where insubordination couldn't be tolerated. Ermine argued that orders must sometimes be questioned, especially given the mission's dubious morality. Eesha, looking conflicted but resolute, acknowledged the discord among the crew (glancing pointedly at Grace and Caelen) but stated her current orders were to report to Ermine and follow her directives.

## The Situation
The party remains divided.

Outside Group (Caelen, Grace, Ermine, Eesha, Sandro, Gary, Ulric): Have escaped the enclosure and encountered Eesha, who brings a starkly different, Federation-loyalist perspective on the mission and recent events. They are heading towards unknown machine sounds in the vast cavern system, accompanied by Empire personnel. Eesha awaits Commander Ermine's orders.
Inside Group (Garrik, Causticus, Joseph, Primus Rex): Remain within the enclosure's upper terrace. They have formed a tense, temporary alliance with Malik and the Queensguard, ostensibly to rescue Queen Caroline by attacking the other creature-avatars. Fate is supposedly on the other side of the structure. Primus Rex is less than an hour away from completing its Neutronium-based weapon synthesis. Vanessa is present, her loyalties and motivations unclear.
