# Episode 8 - On the Run

## Chaos in the Throne Room
The session began in the aftermath of a chaotic confrontation in the throne room of Queen Caroline the Undying. The Queen had turned hostile, unleashing laser fire on the group.  Golden androids had engaged in a fierce battle, but were ultimately destroyed.  Acolyte, in a decisive move, had used advanced technology to command the Queen's guard to attack her.  However, their attempt failed, leaving the guards in a state of shock and confusion.  The Queen, seizing the opportunity, had made a daring escape by leaping out of the window.    

## A Shift in Leadership
Acolyte attempted to persuade the remaining Queen's guards to surrender.  One guard yielded, kneeling and dropping his weapon, while the captain was consumed by guilt and confusion.  The third guard rushed to the window to locate the Queen.  Acolyte followed, witnessing the Queen's daring escape using a grapple hook to swing through the palace windows.    

## Countdown and Communication
An elevator's digital counter began a mysterious countdown, raising concerns about an impending event.  Garrik stressed the urgency of contacting the Federation ship Valkyrie to prevent its imminent landing, which could lead to a catastrophic antimatter explosion.    

## Diplomatic Tensions
The group's attention turned to the Empire diplomat, Sandro Destroci, who was urgently trying to communicate with his team.  Garrik suggested leaving the palace and avoiding both the Federation and the Empire.  Causticus, seeking to replace her damaged communication device, attempted to intimidate Sandro into handing over his communicator, with Garrik's assistance.  Sandro, intimidated, relinquished his communicator, revealing the Queen's apparent targeting of communication devices.    

## A Desperate Act
The captain of the Queen's guard, overwhelmed by guilt and despair, committed suicide.  His colleague, taking charge, prepared to leave and inform others of the situation.  Caelen's attack proved ineffective, and the two guards escaped through the window.    

## Escape from the Palace
The group decided to escape using the staircase.  As they descended, the Queen's voice echoed through the palace, accusing the group of being agents of Vexus and inciting her people to kill them.  The Queen's threat to unleash the power of Lyria, potentially referring to the planet-destroying laser, added to the urgency of their escape.    

## Distrust and Revelation
The group debated the trustworthiness of the Empire and the Federation, with Garrik expressing deep mistrust towards the Empire.  The group decided to free Gary, who was still locked up in the prison below.  Causticus suggested that Jensen escort Sandro to free Gary while the rest of the group continued their descent.  Jensen agreed, expressing his intention to follow his moral compass.    

## Urgent Concerns
With Jensen and Sandro gone, the group discussed the threat posed by the Valkyrie's imminent landing and the need to secure a lander for their escape.  The group's distrust of both the Empire and the Federation deepened as they questioned their motives and the urgency of their mission.  The group's conflicting accounts and the lack of transparency from both sides created confusion and uncertainty.    

## Escape and Pursuit
The group decided to escape through the cave system.  They encountered a setback when the samples collected from the golden androids proved to be highly corrosive, damaging Garrik's rifle.  Caelen's attempt to contain the substance was unsuccessful, and the group was forced to flee as the Queen's guards pursued them.    

## A Desperate Climb
The group decided to climb the laser mountain to reach the Empire lander.  They were hindered by exhaustion and the increasing presence of hostile creatures.  Upon reaching the top, they discovered the corpse of Indigo March, a victim of the myconids.    

## Final Confrontation and Escape
The group contacted the Valkyrie, requesting assistance in bringing down the lander.  As they waited, the myconids attacked, but were shot down by the lander's defenses.  The group attempted to board the lander using a rope ladder, but Ermine, Garrik, and Causticus lost their grip and fell.  The lander, with the rest of the group on board, ascended to safety, leaving the three stranded on the mountaintop.
