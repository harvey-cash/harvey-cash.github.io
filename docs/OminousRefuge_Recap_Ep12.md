# Episode 12 - The Light

## Rescue From the Void
Caelen, already in a spacesuit, grabbed two more suits from the airlock. Ulrich, piloting the lander, remained in the pressurized cabin. Caelen successfully retrieved Acolyte and Grace, noticing Grace's injured hip. Three more bodies, those of Empire officers Gabriel, Hannah, and Beatrice, floated in space. Eesha and Captain Zhan Douji, clad in power armor, observed the situation. They pulled Gabriel back inside the Valkyrie, leaving Hannah and Beatrice to drift away.

Caelen, realizing he couldn't save Hannah and Beatrice in time, closed the airlock door. He then repressurized the airlock. Acolyte and Grace regained consciousness. Grace discovered that she had no feeling in her lower body.

## Escape from the Valkyrie
Inside the lander, Ulrich busied himself at the control console, violently jerking the ship as he maneuvered it away from the Valkyrie. Acolyte healed everyone on board, including Primus Rex, which emitted a pulse of red light in response. Caelen examined Grace's injuries, confirming her paralysis.

Ulrich explained that the Valkyrie wasn't firing upon them, suggesting they hide in a swamp until the situation cooled down. He revealed that he was a "pretend administrator," lacking extensive piloting experience. He also admitted that the ship was barely under his control.

Caelen offered to pilot the lander, and Ulrich agreed. Caelen decided to survey the area before landing, using the ship's sensors.

## Surface Conflict
On the surface, a group consisting of Sandro, Gary, Jenson, Ermine, Garrik, and Causticus were surrounded by an ever-growing number of golden mechanical droid-like sandworms. The worms emerged from neutronium orbs, forming a ring around the group.

Tanath informed Garrik that a large group of Drybridge farmers and townspeople were approaching. The approaching group was potentially hostile, or would be slaughtered by the robotic worms. Ermine determined that the worms would continue to emerge if the crowd approached the orb.

The orb itself glowed and hummed, seemingly charging up. Suddenly, the Empire lander, piloted by Caelen, descended through the atmosphere towards their position. Garrik attempted to position himself between the neutronium and where the ship would land.

Garrik urged everyone to disperse and find hiding spots. Jenson began firing at the worms. Ermine was ensnared by a worm that emerged from beneath her. Garrik was also blocked by a worm.

## The Lander's Return
Caelen, Acolyte, Grace, and Ulrich surveyed the scene from the lander. Ulrich suggested they leave, but Acolyte insisted they rescue their companions. Caelen brought the lander in low, attempting to create an advantageous flanking position.

Caelen then attempted to use the lander's weapons, but found them password protected. He communicated with Sandro, who confirmed the need for the weapons and told them that Causticus had taken his admin privileges. Acolyte suggested retrieving Sandro to pilot the ship.

Caelen performed a rough landing, crushing several worms. However, more worms latched onto the underside of the ship. Caelen attempted to take off again, but the ship remained encrusted with worms.

Garrik managed to free Ermine by grappling and throwing the worm. Ermine signaled to the others to regroup at the lander. Grace, still on the lander, realized that the worms were reacting to the orb.

Ulrich, attempting to use the lander's weapons, called down to Sandro for assistance. Sandro boarded the ship and fired a laser projectile at the orb. The orb retaliated, disabling the ship's systems and causing it to crash land.

## Confrontation and Cataclysm
Caelen urged everyone to evacuate the ship as the worms began drilling through the floor. Grace observed that the worms were now focused on the orb.

Suddenly, a large group of Drybridge citizens appeared, followed by the voice of Queen Caroline the Undying, emanating from the orb. She declared that everyone would be destroyed. The moon, Lyria, began to glow intensely.

The Valkyrie descended from orbit, with Fate announcing their intention to destroy the aliens. A cacophony of voices filled the air, with Caroline declaring, "You're all going to die."

The moonlight intensified, and everyone braced for impact. However, a black cylinder erupted from the ground, deploying a curtain that blocked the moonlight. The curtain formed a dome, protecting everyone within.

The neutronium orb floated into the air, but was then impaled by a spear of neutronium. The Valkyrie crashed into the sand. The golden worms surrounding the dome ceased functioning.

Inside the dome, black dividing walls went up, plunging everyone into darkness. Caelen, Ulrich, Sandro, Gary, Jenson, and Causticus found themselves together.

## Enclosed
The group explored the interior of the dome, finding it to be a 30-foot diameter sphere. They felt a lurch and a sensation of rising.

Sandro questioned the others about what had happened since they parted ways. He revealed that he had found Gary and Jenson, and that they had accomplished their mission of obtaining neutronium. He also expressed concern about the Valkyrie's knowledge of the Empire vessel's location.

Acolyte informed Sandro of the deaths of Beatrice and Hannah, and that his father was still alive on the Valkyrie. Ulrich identified Jenson as a spy and traitor, and offered to become a whistleblower for the Empire in exchange for passage back to their star systems.

Ulrich then questioned Ermine and Causticus about their allegiances. He revealed that he was not Federation, and that the Syndicate had sent him to retrieve the neutronium. He also revealed that the Syndicate believed there was a third person among them with more knowledge of the mission.

Garrik suggested that they set aside allegiances and focus on survival. Ulrich shared his knowledge of neutronium, revealing that it was a theoretical element that the Federation was interested in. He also mentioned that certain electromagnetic frequencies might be able to permeate or be absorbed by it.

Ulrich then turned to Caelen, questioning his knowledge of the mission. Caelen claimed that his expertise was in entry and exit, not neutronium. Acolyte publicly revealed that Caelen was not a member of the Syndicate. Ulrich threatened Caelen's life.

Suddenly, the group felt weightless as the sand rose into the air. They were then slammed back down, with the sand shifting to a different position.

## A New Location
The group theorized that they had been accelerating for the past 10 minutes, and that the engine had cut off and restarted at a different angle. Over the next 48 hours, the acceleration, weightlessness, and acceleration continued.

Eventually, the acceleration settled down, and the group felt lighter. A seam of white light opened up on one side of the orb, and it popped open. The group found themselves in an enormous atrium of a vast alien civilization.

Before the session ended, Grace cast a non-detection spell on everyone in the party.
