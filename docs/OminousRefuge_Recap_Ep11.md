# Episode 11 - Syndication

## Valkyrie in Orbit
The scene opened aboard the Valkyrie, where Caelen had just witnessed a massive battleship warping into the solar system. Fate, ever the pragmatist, immediately tasked Caelen with assisting Ulric and the administration in retrofitting the Empire lander for a return trip to the Graftian surface. Caelen, however, had other priorities. He wanted to check on the Acolyte, Joseph, and Grace, who had been hauled off to the brig.

Making his way stealthily through the eerily deserted ship, Caelen reached Steven's quarters. A quick investigation revealed that the room was undisturbed, and the hidden weapons cache remained untouched. With a combination of stealth and a well-timed display of feigned grief, Caelen managed to retrieve a concealed pocket blaster. Satisfied, he headed towards the airlock to find Ulric.

## The Brig
Meanwhile, in the brig, Joseph, Grace, and the Empire officers found themselves confined within a cell. The moment they entered, all their electronic devices went silent, nullified by the brig's dampening field. The Captain, Zhan Douji, and Eesha, clad in power armor, retreated down the hallway, engaged in an urgent, hushed discussion.

Joseph, ever the pragmatist, assessed the situation. He wondered if they could overpower Fate, given her augmentations. Grace, meanwhile, focused on the cameras, deciding to destroy the ones on their suits to prevent further surveillance. Gabriel, one of the Empire crew, spoke of fragmented memories and a vast, cosmic face.

The conversation between Zhan Douji and Eesha grew louder, and the prisoners overheard the name "Ermine" being mentioned. This sparked a discussion about their potential escape, but the brig was heavily fortified. Grace, however, noticed a peculiar marking on the toilet seat – a small antique shotgun etched into the rim.

Upon pressing the marking, the toilet revolved, revealing a hidden compartment containing a large shotgun, identical to the one Caelen had used previously. A plan began to form: they would wait for an opportunity, perhaps during feeding time, to ambush their captors.

## Graft's Surface
The scene shifted to the Graftian surface, where Ermine, Garrik, and Causticus, accompanied by Triss, Tanath, and their scouts, trekked across the desolate landscape. They had just passed the massive tidal dam and spotted a strange, black, perfectly polished sphere in the distance.

As they ventured further into the barren terrain, they encountered remnants of ancient structures, burned and weathered by time. Ermine's technology detected an energy signature nearby, and Garrik, attempting to investigate with his mining rifle, inadvertently damaged the device.

Causticus, with her encyclopedic knowledge of technology, managed to repair the rifle and extracted a small, cold, black sphere – an unknown material that defied all analysis. The sphere emitted a faint radio signal.

As they continued their journey, they discovered more of these spheres, culminating in the discovery of the large, central orb. Suddenly, the smaller orbs cracked open, revealing golden, mechanical creatures – constructs similar to the Queen's Guard.

## Retrofitting the Lander
Back on the Valkyrie, Caelen joined Ulric and the administration at the airlock, where they were struggling to move Primus Rex into the Empire lander. Caelen, using his experience with moving large equipment, quickly took charge, efficiently guiding the robot into the ship.

While moving the robot, Caelen surreptitiously removed a panel from the moving equipment. He presented it to Ulric, feigning concern that it had broken off the robot. Ulric dismissed his worries, indicating a general disregard for the mission's details.

Caelen then attempted to convince Ulric to retrieve Joseph and Grace from the brig, arguing that their piloting skills would be invaluable. Ulric, however, refused, fearing Fate's reaction. Despite Caelen's efforts, Ulric remained unmoved.

## Confrontation in the Brig
In the brig, Zhan Douji and Eesha approached the cell, their argument still ongoing. They revealed that those who disobeyed orders had been ejected from the ship. Zhan Douji, in a moment of vulnerability, sought guidance from Joseph, who offered words of encouragement.

Grace, meanwhile, brandished the shotgun she had found, demanding their release. Zhan Douji, however, calmly disarmed her, taking the weapon for herself. As she prepared to leave, Grace made a desperate attempt to escape, but Zhan Douji overpowered her, inflicting a severe injury.

Before leaving, Eesha asked about Ermine's safety, revealing her concern for her.

## A Desperate Gamble
Back in the lander, Caelen received a distress call from Sergeant Gary, who had encountered the golden creatures on the surface. Caelen, sensing an opportunity, confronted Ulric, hinting at his involvement with the Earth Syndicate.

Ulric, taken aback, revealed that he was indeed a member of the Syndicate and that he had been expecting backup. Caelen, mirroring his secrecy, provided the location of the brig. Ulric, after a moment of hesitation, took control of the lander, locking out his administration team and piloting the ship towards the brig.

As he navigated the ship, he revealed that he had been expecting a contact, but not one who acted so openly. He then crashed the lander into the side of the Valkyrie, directly outside the brig, causing a catastrophic breach.

## Vacuum
The sudden decompression sucked Joseph and Grace out into the vacuum of space. Caelen, witnessing the horror through the display window, desperately searched for spacesuits. He found two suits and attempted to open the damaged airlock door, but his efforts were hampered by Ulric's erratic piloting.

Grace, exposed to the vacuum, suffered severe injuries. Joseph, using his abilities, attempted to shield himself and Grace from the worst of the damage.

## Battle on the Surface
On Graft, the golden droids emerged from the ground, attacking Ermine, Garrik, and Causticus. Ermine, recognizing the droids' composition, realized that they were heavily armored with neutronium. She urged her companions to retreat, but Garrik, fascinated by the orb, remained behind.

Causticus, attempting to investigate the orb, triggered a defensive mechanism, suffering damage from an energy surge. The scouts, following Ermine's lead, began to retreat, but some were injured in the process.

Suddenly, Jenson, Sandro, and Gary arrived, joining the fray. They had tracked the group using Sandro's communicator and were ready to assist.
