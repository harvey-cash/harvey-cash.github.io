# Episode 10 - The Cavalry

## Rescue

The Empire lander, SS Hercules, picked up Caelen, Acolyte, and Grace from the exploding laser mountain after they were abandoned by the fleeing Ulric. Caelen noticed the figures of Ermine, Causticus, and Garrik falling from the lander as it launched, but suspected they would survive the fall.   

The three survivors were sedated with a medical mist and given a deep rejuvenating sleep, regaining all of their energy and strength in the process.   

## Awakening

They awoke in the cramped airlock of the SS Hercules, with a clear window view into the rest of the ship. Acolyte, in a confused state, pulled the emergency lever to vent the airlock, but it was immediately locked by the crew.   

A conversation ensued between Acolyte and the ranking Empire officer, Flight Lieutenant Gabriel, revealing that the Empire had rescued them from the laser, which they had hacked. Gabriel explained that they were under direct orders from the Valkyrie to deliver the survivors to the ship.   

## Samples and Sandro

The survivors discussed the lack of biological samples and the importance of collecting them. Grace thanked the Empire crew for saving them and inquired about the journey back to the Valkyrie. Gabriel informed them that it would take approximately 45 minutes to dock.   

Grace expressed interest in learning more about the Empire's mission on the planet and inquired about Sandro Destroci's whereabouts. Gabriel revealed that Sandro was still on the planet and had last been heard from when the Valkyrie crew encountered him.   

## Gabriel's Revelation

Acolyte appealed to Gabriel's emotions, implying that Sandro would be in danger if they returned to the Valkyrie without samples. Gabriel expressed concern for his son, but insisted that they had to follow orders. He questioned the survivors about Sandro's absence and the fate of Indigo March, the Empire's comms officer.   

Acolyte informed Gabriel of Indigo's death, leading to an emotional outburst from Science Officer Beatrice Way, who blamed the laser for Indigo's demise. Caelen clarified that Indigo's death was caused by a local creature, not the native humanoids.   

## Truth and Persuasion

The survivors discussed whether to ask Gabriel about the Empire's true mission on the planet. Acolyte inquired about the mission's progress, leading to an awkward silence before Gabriel expressed reluctance to share information with Federation members.   

Caelen appealed to Gabriel's sense of camaraderie, emphasizing their shared humanity. The survivors made a group persuasion check, successfully convincing Gabriel to open up.   

Gabriel revealed that Sandro was his son and expressed pride in his accomplishments. He also shared that Sandro had been instrumental in getting the Empire to investigate the disappearance of Trappist-1's starlight, suggesting the possibility of a megastructure built by an advanced alien civilization.   

## Docking and Deception

The Valkyrie appeared in the distance and began docking with the Empire lander. Acolyte inquired about the Empire's plan, and Gabriel explained their intention to return to their mission after transferring the survivors.   

As the docking process was completed, the Empire lander experienced a cyberattack, causing both airlock doors to open simultaneously. The survivors saw Captain Douji and Isha at the end of the corridor, armed with rifles.   

## Confrontation and Casualties

The captain ordered the Empire crew to drop their weapons, but Gabriel hesitated. Acolyte urged them to comply, and they eventually did. However, as they stood unarmed, Gabriel was suddenly shot in the head and killed.   

The survivors reacted with shock and dismay, while the remaining Empire crew members, Beatrice and Hannah, cowered in fear. Fate emerged from behind the captain and Isha, demanding the samples and ignoring the recent violence.   

## Fate's Authority

Acolyte attempted to reason with Fate, arguing that Gabriel could have been valuable leverage in dealing with the Empire. Caelen added that Gabriel and Sandro could be key to establishing lasting peace with the Empire.   

Fate, unmoved by their arguments, agreed to let Acolyte attempt to revive Gabriel. Acolyte used his advanced medical technology to bring Gabriel back to life.   

## Observations and Insights

Fate expressed satisfaction with Gabriel's revival, as it provided them with another person to interrogate. Caelen made an insights check, trying to gauge Fate's intentions towards the remaining Empire crew members. He sensed that Fate felt no immediate inclination to harm them, but could not be trusted to spare their lives in the long run.   

The survivors observed the state of the Valkyrie crew, noting Captain Douji's exhaustion and the absence of the engineers and science officers. Caelen made another insights check, focusing on the relationship between Fate, Captain Douji, Isha, and Ulric. He sensed a clear deference to Fate from everyone, indicating her authority in the current situation.   

## Grace's Interrogation

Caelen attempted to engage Captain Douji in conversation, but she responded with a curt order to return to the ship. Grace, meanwhile, made an insights check, comparing Fate's demeanor to that of the Queen. She realized that both Fate and the Queen were driven by their goals and wielded power without compassion.   

Fate, growing impatient with the delay, urged the survivors to return to the Valkyrie and learn more about the mission. The captain and Isha began escorting them back to the ship, while Fate and Primus Rex remained behind to requisition the Empire lander.   

## Briefing and Betrayal

The survivors were taken to the central conference room, where they were questioned by Ulric and Fate about the aliens and the samples. Caelen revealed that he had left a hidden cache of weapons in his old quarters, which could be compromised by the Federation's access to the Empire's data.   

Fate, using her advanced technology, reviewed the survivors' body cam footage and discovered Grace's clandestine meeting with an unknown contact on Acheron station. She questioned Grace's loyalty to the Federation, prompting a defiant response.   

## Destruction and Deception

Fate, in a show of force, launched a "rod from God" kinetic weapon from the Valkyrie, obliterating the laser mountain and potentially killing the remaining survivors on the surface. She then ordered Grace to be taken to the brig, dismissing her scientific concerns in favor of the mission's existential goals.   

Caelen, witnessing Fate's ruthlessness, verbally agreed to follow the Federation's orders, but with a subtle hint of deception. Acolyte also expressed his cooperation, but with a deceptive undertone. Fate, sensing their deception, ordered them to be taken to the brig as well.   

## The Cavalry Arrives

Fate, addressing Caelen directly, revealed that the Valkyrie was merely the advanced party and that a Federation battleship had arrived in the system. This revelation left Caelen to ponder their next move, while Grace and Acolyte remained imprisoned and the fates of Ermine, Causticus, and Garrik remained unknown.
