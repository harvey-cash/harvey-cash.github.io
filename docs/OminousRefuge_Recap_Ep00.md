# Episode #0 - Chaos on Acheron

## Arrival at Acheron Station

The Acheron system, glittering core of the Federation, pulsed with activity. Its central hub, Acheron Station, was less an airport and more a city built around transit. Vast, Death Star-scale hangar bays dwarfed conventional notions of spaceports, filled with the ceaseless movement of cargo and the imposing forms of interstellar vessels. Between these industrial behemoths sprawled a network of conveniences – bars humming with the low murmur of conversation, lounges filled with passengers enduring delays measured in weeks or months, victims of the sublight crawl between systems. Thousands thronged the station's concourses, a chaotic symphony of species and purposes.

Far out, at the system's edge, lay the prize: the jump gate. A colossal structure capable of bending reality itself, creating a bubble of folded space-time to hurl ships like the *Valkyrie* across the unfathomable distances between stars. The *Valkyrie*'s destination: the Trappist-1 system, a place shrouded in the mists of galactic history, its details sparse even in official Federation briefings.

Each individual summoned to the *Valkyrie*'s crew had received their notice differently – a formal requisition via interstellar mail, a coded message, a direct order delivered by a Federation associate. However conveyed, the directive was clear: report to Acheron Station and join the mission.

## Ermine's Task

Within the comparative serenity of a business-class lounge, Ermine Lakeford reviewed mission documents. Fresh from a diplomatic triumph on the Federation's fringes – coaxing a strategically vital border planet back from the brink of Empire membership – she was sharp, focused, and newly wealthy from a substantial bonus. Her success, however, was immediately followed by this new, urgent assignment aboard the *Valkyrie*. As she waited for her assistant, Ermine delved into the sparse information available on Trappist-1, noting the troubling lack of clarity surrounding the mission's history and, more immediately concerning, the chaotic state of the *Valkyrie*'s crew manifest. Names seemed provisional, slots unfilled or recently vacated.

The hiss of pneumatics announced the arrival of Eesha, Ermine's personal security detail. Clad in formidable, whirring power armor, Eesha navigated the lounge with surprising delicacy, carefully balancing a tiny cup of espresso and a large matcha latte. "Ermine," she stated, presenting the espresso. "Black, no sugar, nothing else. Am I right?"

"Yes, thank you, Eesha," Ermine replied, accepting the cup.

"Excellent. Well, I've learned which docking bay we need to go to. We're heading there right now. Is there anything else you'd like... or should we just head there straight away?"

"No, no, I think we should get cracking," Ermine decided.

Eesha turned, positioning herself slightly ahead of Ermine, her armored form a clear deterrent. The moment they stepped out of the cool, polished calm of the lounge, the station's overwhelming reality assaulted them – a cacophony of noise, smells, and the sheer press of bodies. A group, seemingly activists or protesters, moved to intercept them. "You look important! You gotta tell us why has our ship been delayed?" one demanded.

Without breaking stride, Eesha produced a shock baton. With practiced efficiency, she began clearing a path, the weapon's discharge punctuating the air as she mercilessly carved a space around Ermine, all while keeping her own matcha latte perfectly steady. "So, Ermine," Eesha asked calmly amidst the controlled brutality, "did you learn anything about the ship, about the mission, from your reading these documents?"

Ermine, unperturbed within the protective sphere Eesha maintained, sipped her espresso. "The crew manifest is a heap of shit," she stated flatly. "We need to do something about this before we leave."

"Oh dear," Eesha sighed. "I was very concerned to find out we'd suddenly be requisitioned without much knowledge. Last time I was on Acheron, I was part of a squad... I really don't hope to be part of that same squad again."

"Well, I'll send you the files for the crew requisitions," Ermine offered. "You can see if anyone you're concerned about is on this list. And we can discuss it with the captain."

"Oh, we may not have to worry about reading documents, because here we are." Eesha swiped an access tag. A massive blast shield door hissed open, allowing them passage before slamming shut behind them, cutting off the clamor of the desperate citizens left outside.

They stepped into an enormous hangar bay dominated by the imposing bulk of the *Valkyrie*. Waiting near the gangplank was Captain Zhan Douji, her relief palpable. "Oh, Ermine! Jesus, thank the Federation you're here," she exclaimed, striding forward. "Bit hectic right now, but I'm very glad you could make it in time for our departure. We have a slot at the jump gate that we have to hit in the next several days, and to get there we need to be setting off almost immediately. I'm still trying to tie up the last details on the manifest. Some things got changed around at the last minute, which I'm dealing with. Do you mind? Could I delegate some crew selection to you? I hate to ask, but I know that you've got the experience."

"Yes, of course," Ermine agreed without hesitation.

"Great, thank you." Captain Douji gestured across the hangar floor. "There's those over there – they're miners from Galminco." Ermine recognized the name instantly; Galminco was the Federation's largest mining contractor, their operations spanning the galaxy. "Galminco won the contract," Douji continued, "and they sent over several employees. But because of the changes in the manifest, we don't have room for everyone. They've sent three employees they want on the ship. We need to narrow that down to one. If you can do that for me."

"Of course," Ermine confirmed again, turning with Eesha towards the indicated group.

## Garrik's Rough Start

Five minutes earlier, Garrik Redstone had stumbled out of one of the station's less reputable, blue-collar bars, heavily intoxicated. On his arm, equally unsteady, was his recently wedded wife, Vanessa. Garrik felt the lingering disorientation from a strange, impromptu meeting where shadowy figures had mentioned someone specific aboard the *Valkyrie* who would supposedly "take care of him." Before he could process this, he'd been intercepted by Alton Trask, a supervisor from Galminco.

"Just stand over here," Trask had ordered curtly. "We've been told there's a delay or something. I don't know why. What? Are you drunk, Garrik?"

"Yes. As always," Garrik slurred good-naturedly.

"Do you want to get on this mission or not?" Trask hissed.

"Of course I do! Of course I do! And *you* want me to get on this mission as well, don't you?" Garrik countered, perhaps with more confidence than his state warranted.

"You're gonna have to convince *me* that I still want you, turning up drunk for work. And who... who is this?" Trask eyed Vanessa suspiciously. "I don't see a Galminco identification on you."

"I'm sure I'm Galminco," Vanessa chimed in hazily. "I'll... I work for... Gao..."

"You don't work for us," Trask snapped. "Garrik, explain what's going on, otherwise I'm going to terminate your contract!"

"I'm pretty sure you got a job, right?" Garrik appealed to Vanessa. "You got... you got a job on the ship. We've talked about this."

"Yeah, yeah," Vanessa mumbled, trying to focus. "I'm like... the ship's doctor, probably."

At that moment, Ermine Lakeford, flanked by her imposing bodyguard, approached the small group of miners. The scene was less than impressive: Garrik and Vanessa reeking of alcohol, the flustered Trask, and two other, more sober and professional-looking miners standing by quietly.

"You three," Ermine addressed the potential candidates, her gaze sharp despite the lingering scent of cheap liquor wafting from Garrik. "You're all fine, I presume? Can you tell me a little bit about your skills and why you should be on this mission?"

Garrik puffed himself up. "I'm a miner! Been in mining for all my life, as far as I remember, since childhood. I have a big collection of rare earth minerals! I've mined everything and everywhere, and I think you wouldn't be able to do without me! And my wife here," he added, gesturing proudly at the swaying Vanessa, "is a doctor! A very proficient doctor. She'll heal everyone on the sheep!"

"Promise?" Vanessa managed, followed by a loud, undignified hiccup.

"Promise," Garrik affirmed. He leaned in conspiratorially. "We're getting married, by the way, so we're just celebrating here a little bit, you know."

"Yeah, we're getting married!" Vanessa threw her arm around Garrik's neck.

Ermine's expression remained neutral, though perhaps tinged with distaste. "My warmest congratulations to you both. So, next candidate, please. Same question."

A slightly older woman with closely shaved hair and a ring of planetary service medals stepped forward, snapping a crisp Federation salute. When asked about her skills, she delivered a flawless resume, listing proficiencies with numerous advanced mining technologies and experience far exceeding anything Garrik had claimed. Crucially, she was sober.

"Well, thank you for your time," Ermine concluded swiftly. "I think, in lieu of the Captain, this lady is probably best suited to the mission we have at hand. So, if you would follow me."

"Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am," the chosen miner replied smartly, turning towards the *Valkyrie*'s gangplank.

"Hang on!" Garrik interjected loudly. "I would like a dispute here! Has this lady mined Neutronium in her life, as I have?" (He'd initially blurted out "Zephyrite," a clearly fabricated mineral, but quickly corrected himself, hoping the mention of the notoriously rare and difficult Neutronium might impress).

"Ma'am, I'm fairly sure that Neutronium mining on the scale he implies is practically mythical," the selected miner scoffed. "This guy has no idea what he's talking about."

"Well, well, they say it's made up," Garrik retorted, "but it's those miners who *haven't* mined it that say that!" He was bluffing, trying desperately to salvage the situation. Ermine, assessing him, sensed a flicker of something – perhaps sheer audacity, perhaps a hidden truth – but it wasn't nearly enough to outweigh the other candidate's obvious competence and sobriety. The professional miner began walking towards the ship.

## Causticus and the Mysterious Cargo

Meanwhile, Causticus arrived in the hangar bay, her extensive workshop and collection of cybernetic augmentations, tools, and spare parts having been transported at Federation expense. Her summons had been specific, if secretive, hinting at ancient, potentially invaluable technology on Trappist-1 that required her unique expertise as a highly augmented individual. She traveled alone, without escort or corporate affiliation.

Her augmented senses immediately picked out an unusual procession across the hangar: administrators clad in deep red robes adorned with heavy gold chains, escorting a large, cuboid machine floating on a mag-lift trolley. It resembled a compacted battle tank or perhaps a folded transformer, humming with latent power. Accompanying them was another cyborg, a woman whose features Causticus's internal systems quickly identified.

*Target Identified: FATE. Federation Employee.*

As Causticus processed the information, Fate seemed alerted, perhaps by a counter-surveillance measure detecting the scan. She turned, met Causticus's gaze across the distance, and gave a slight wave, beckoning her over.

"Hello, Causticus," Fate greeted warmly as she approached. "It's very nice to meet you finally. My name is Fate. I am... well, I suppose you could say that I'm here to receive you, to take care of you as you take care of all of us on the ship. So we're very glad to have you. Thank you very much for joining us."

"What do you mean, 'take care of me'?" Causticus asked, her tone cautious.

"So, I'm aware that, like myself, you are an augmented being," Fate explained smoothly. "And we're aware that there are limitations to what cyborgs such as ourselves are able to do in space environments and unforeseen atmospheric conditions. In a circumstance like Trappist-1, where we truly do not know what we're going to run into, it's helpful to provide extra support for those of us who are not the standard biological stock."

"Okay, fair enough," Causticus conceded. "Pleased to meet you."

"Very pleased to meet you, too." Fate gestured towards the large machine the robed figures were now carefully maneuvering into a side loading bay of the *Valkyrie*. Causticus studied it – it radiated potential, dense with folded mechanisms. Fate noticed her gaze and tapped the metallic casing. "Yes, well, I'm not only here to take care of you. I'm also taking care of this guy over here." She produced an identification tag, seamlessly integrating it with Causticus's systems. "Please take this. This is your official *Valkyrie* identification. You have access to all parts of the ship, as we expect that we'll need your expertise in the case of anything going wrong. So feel free to board and make yourself at home."

"Okay. Thank you," Causticus replied. Curiosity piqued, she asked, "So what *are* you carrying?"

"Oh, this here is Primus Rex," Fate said, her voice lowering slightly. "He's been asleep for a very long time, and we're taking him with us just in case we need to wake him up... in the case of the real worst eventualities."

Causticus scanned her internal databases. *Primus Rex.* The name yielded nothing. No history, no technical specifications, no Federation records readily available. Fate herself remained an enigma; beyond her official employee status, information was scant. Despite the lack of data, Causticus accepted the clearance and moved to follow Fate and the reverent administrators escorting Primus Rex aboard the *Valkyrie*. As she did, she registered the ongoing dispute near the Galminco miners involving Ermine and the drunken Garrik, and noted the clear leader of the red-robed administrators – a man whose profile identified him as Ulrich.

## Acolyte Seeks Passage

Elsewhere in the bustling station city, Joseph Acolyte immersed himself in the digital archives of Jacob Scion, founder of the Order of the Path. He meticulously parsed theological texts and ancient forum posts, seeking deeper understanding to better spread the Path's teachings. Word had reached him through the Order's network: the *Valkyrie*, docked at Acheron, lacked a chaplain. Though not officially assigned, Acolyte saw an opportunity – a mission to a lost civilization was fertile ground for new converts. Furthermore, his training as a counselor offered practical skills the crew might value.

Guided by what he perceived as the Path's will, he navigated the station's chaos towards the *Valkyrie*'s docking bay. He soon encountered the procession of administrators in their red robes – similar in color to his own vestments, but signifying bureaucracy, not faith. Ulrich, their apparent leader, turned and addressed him, noting his attire.

"What have we here? Some Path person trying to get onto our ship?" Ulrich's tone was dismissive.

"I have only been led where the Path has led me," Acolyte proclaimed earnestly. "This is a place that is in need of great teaching and comfort and guidance. I am here to offer myself."

"Guidance," Ulrich scoffed. "Also in need of documentation and paperwork and an officially sanctioned mission profile. Do you have any of *these* things?"

"We will find these things when we look inside ourselves," Acolyte countered. "I have what you need. It's just not in the form of paperwork. It's in the form of words and knowledge and sharing and guidance. These are the things that I bring. These are my passes onto the ship."

"Right, right. Yeah. No, no, it's not gonna happen," Ulrich stated flatly. "Guidance isn't recognized as official tender anywhere in the galaxy, as far as I'm aware."

Overhearing the exchange, Garrik, still embroiled in his own attempt to board, saw an opportunity or perhaps genuinely felt a connection to Acolyte's words. "I... I overhear some profound meaning in what the acolyte says," Garrik announced, approaching them. "This guy is with me. Can he... can he come through? And then please let me in as well."

"Oh?" Ulrich turned his skeptical gaze to Garrik. "You, miner man, who I'm now just meeting. Why are you vouching for this random Path acolyte? You know this man?"

"I think he's saying some profound truth!" Garrik insisted. "And yes! He's my good friend! We've been drinking together! Haven't we?"

"You've been *drinking* together?" Ulrich raised an eyebrow. "That's very interesting for crew members about to board a spaceship. Well, it looks like you just got yourself kicked off the crew anyway. I see a high Federation diplomat up there denying your entry to the ship. Mind telling me what's going on there, random miner man?"

"Oh, you've heard some false information," Garrik blustered, trying to regain control. "I think they were very impressed with my achievements! And I'm sure I'll get on the ship easily, along with my wife here!" He looked around. "Oh, yes, your wife here. Hang on. Where is she? Where's she gone?" Vanessa, momentarily separated in the throng, reappeared, looking confused.

## Caelen and the Armorer

On the opposite side of the *Valkyrie*, near a secondary cargo ramp, Caelen anxiously watched as station deckhands began loading his sophisticated architectural urbanization drones. These large, autonomous machines were crucial for establishing settlements or temporary colonies, vital for the mission's potential long-term objectives – provided the ship had competent miners to supply raw materials.

Standing nearby, observing the minor commotion involving Garrik and the administrators, was a large, imposing man with fiery ginger hair and weathered features, clad in heavy practical armor. He casually held an antique shotgun, a stark contrast to the energy weapons common in 3310. He clapped Caelen jovially on the back.

"Hey! Oh, this kerfuffle... no good, no good. Too much spit in the air," the man grumbled in a thick, archaic accent. "The weapons, they need to stay nice and dry. Or soaked in oil. Keep them lubricated." He glanced down at Caelen. "You see, you're a boy... you're not... Caelen, you're not packing! Why you not packing?"

"No, no," Caelen replied, slightly flustered. "I... I thought we weren't allowed to bring weapons on the ship if we're not military."

"Ah! *I'm* not allowed to bring weapons on the ship!" the man chuckled. "*You're* not allowed to. Very well done!"

Caelen's gaze fell on the shotgun. His family had a long history with munitions; knowledge passed down through generations sparked recognition. "But that's a fine piece of kit you've got there. I think... is that..." Caelen accessed his internal knowledge base, cross-referencing the design. "Oh! It's a fine Beretta you've got there! That's... that's antique! As in, that's like at least 300, 400 years old!"

"Hey! Well, you got a keen eye there, lad. Aye, it is. It's much older than that," the man confirmed, pleased. "This specific shotgun, you could argue this goes back all the way... all the way to the Origin. To the home world. Of course," he conceded, "it's had its stock changed, and the barrel got refurbished at one point, and... well, of course, it had to get upgraded to use the non-explosive shells they manufacture nowadays. But the soul of this thing dates back millennia."

"It's remarkable," Caelen said, genuinely impressed. "It's been remarkably preserved."

"Aye, well, that's sort of my job. This piece is a bit of a hobby of mine." He gestured behind him with his thumb, towards where stacks upon stacks of modern energy weapons were being loaded, mirroring Caelen's drones. "This is my day job. Those ones over there... newfangled, manky, shoddy, modern laser blasters and plasma stuff."

Seeing the deckhands maneuvering his drones, Caelen felt a surge of anxiety. "Excuse me. Sorry, one sec." He hurried over to the workers. "Please be careful with those, please! They're very delicate! Please don't damage them!"

One deckhand, unimpressed, looked him up and down. "This is my job. I'm here to move this thing. Politely... fuck off."

"Can I just check how many units have you loaded so far?" Caelen asked, trying to maintain composure, scanning the manifest on his personal device.

"You've been standing here watching me and my boys load this thing," the deckhand retorted. "We have not loaded any yet. They are going up the ramp."

Caelen did a quick visual scan. "Okay. Seems good. Thank you. Thank you." He returned to the armorer, feeling another slap on the back.

"You have got to stop being so paranoid!" the man advised. "Or at least, if you're going to be paranoid, you gotta have a weapon with you! You know what I mean?"

"Yeah. Sorry. I've just got a lot of... a lot of pressure riding on this mission." Caelen glanced at his communicator, where notifications flooded in – multiple urgent messages from the Federal Institute of Architecture, superiors demanding updates, confusing his assignment with another ship. He mentally composed replies, trying to clarify his posting to the *Valkyrie*.

The armorer gently placed a hand over Caelen's communicator screen. "Hey. You're here now. Sort of gonna work itself out. You don't need to be telling your superiors nothing. You're in the right place. You know where you're going. Let's get on the ship, and I'll let you have a... like, I'll let you fire some of the older items in my collection at the ship's firing range."

"Oh, wow!" The offer immediately eased Caelen's tension. "That would... that would be great. I'd love that. Sorry, I'm just... it's just a lot."

"That it is. That it is, boy." The armorer gestured towards the gangplank, and they began to move towards the ship, joining the disparate groups converging near the *Valkyrie*.

## Chaos Erupts

Suddenly, high-pitched screaming echoed from beyond the main blast doors – the ones Ermine and Eesha had passed through earlier. A collective gasp went through the hangar as the massive doors ground open, just a meter or so, but enough. A torrent of desperate people surged through the gap.

Simultaneously, on the *other* side of those same blast doors, Dr. Grace Augustine finally arrived. Her journey to the *Valkyrie* had been hampered by bureaucratic neglect; the mission's focus on pilots, security, and command staff had left her role as humanitarian representative and anthropologist poorly communicated. She arrived late, finding herself facing the *source* of the chaos: a large crowd of protesters banging on the hangar doors, held back by heavily armored station security.

"We've got to get in! You've got to let us in!" people yelled. "It's not fair being cooped up here for weeks, for months! We've got nothing to eat! The bars won't sell us any food!"

The guards stood firm, their helmet speakers broadcasting warnings in distorted, metallic tones: "Federation personnel only! No one gets through this door!"

Intrigued and concerned by the protesters' plight, Grace pushed into the crowd, momentarily forgetting her own mission. Someone noticed the Federation insignia on her attire. "Hang on! You're what? What are you, like, a member of the... the crew that's behind this door? Can you let us in?"

"Why do you need to get in?" Grace asked.

"We... we've been stuck in this hellhole of a space station for literally weeks!" the man explained desperately. "With like, no food, no support, no supplies! My kids are like, starving, and I have to steal from the places here just to get them to live! We were told we were waiting for transport back to our homeworld. We were all sent here on, like, a delegation... we were *invited* to the Federation to see how good it was going to be for our planet to join! And then we've been unable to get a jump gate back!"

"And how many are you?" Grace inquired.

"I... well, my group personally, I've got twenty, but..." He gestured vaguely at the sea of faces pressing against the security line. "I've spoken to several other people here. They're all pretty much in the same boat. There's like hundreds of us." He listed several nearby star systems, planets only a single jump away. "Every time we make a booking on the jump gate system, we get kicked off by some last-minute Federation mission that is more important than us getting back to our home world so we can *join* the Federation! Which, frankly," he added bitterly, "I don't think that we're going to join the Federation anymore."

"Fair enough, fair enough," Grace murmured sympathetically. "Okay. How about I try to get you in, and we'll talk to the Captain if we can give you a lift?"

"Yes! Yes, please! Do you have clearance? Can you get us in?" the man pleaded. "Or... or at least maybe somebody who like, has the ability to schedule the jump gate for like, as soon as possible?"

"Yeah, that must be horrible. Let's go and check... check what we can do." Galvanized, Grace began pushing towards the front. Recognizing the man with her, the crowd parted slightly. As she reached the security line, the guards scanned her, identifying her official credentials.

"Dr. Grace Augustine. You are on the crew manifest. Come through," one guard stated, initiating the opening sequence for the blast door.

As the door began to slide open that single meter, the pressure from the desperate crowd became too much. One guard stumbled, overwhelmed, and the dam broke. Grace, along with the leading edge of the mob, was violently pushed *through* the opening and into the hangar bay, just as the rest of the prospective *Valkyrie* crew realized their relatively ordered boarding process had dissolved into pandemonium.

## The Scramble for the Valkyrie

The sudden influx threw the hangar into disarray. Inside, personnel reacted instantly:

**Garrik:** Seeing the wave of humanity flood in, he glanced at Ulrich. "Should we get on the ship? You know, we might get injured by this crowd!"
"Oh, holy shit! Yes! We should get on the ship right now! Go, go!" Ulrich urged.
Garrik grabbed Vanessa. "Come on, mate!" he yelled futilely towards Acolyte, who was moving in the opposite direction. Garrik and Vanessa began moving towards the *Valkyrie*, about 150 feet away.

**Grace:** Propelled into the hangar, she spotted Ermine near the center. Ignoring the chaos, she surged forward, closing the distance. "Ermine!" she yelled, confronting the diplomat. "Why are all these people still here?! The Federation invited them to join, and now they're here, they have nowhere to go, they're stuck, they have no food, no place to sleep! What is happening?! Why... you just can't take care of them! Why do we need more people on board?! Why do we want everyone to join the Federation if we can't take care of the people?! Just get your shit together and do something about it! Huh?! Why are they being ignored?!"
Eesha moved to intercept, but Ermine held up a hand, recognizing Grace's Federation attire despite not knowing her.

**Ermine:** Facing Grace's impassioned outburst, she put a restraining hand on Eesha's arm. "I'm not quite sure what's going on here," Ermine replied, her voice level despite the escalating crisis. "I've only just returned to this system myself. But if you have information about this situation that could help us deal with it, then by all means..." In that split second, the two women assessed each other. Grace saw a high-ranking official, part of the system causing this suffering, perhaps not malicious but insulated. Ermine saw a well-meaning but potentially naive activist, unaware of the mission's critical importance and the imminent danger. Shots were about to be fired; the *Valkyrie*'s departure was paramount.

**Caelen:** Already near the secondary cargo ramp, he quickly scanned for immediate threats to himself. Seeing none, but noticing the deckhands abandoning their posts ("I do not get paid enough to tangle with protesters!"), he took initiative. Inspired perhaps by the armorer beside him, he surged forward to continue loading his precious drones himself.
"That's the spirit, lad!" the armorer boomed, joining him. Together, they began muscling the heavy equipment up the ramp.

**Causticus:** Assessing the chaos, her augmented senses prioritized efficiency and safety. Identifying Grace Augustine as an authorized but vulnerable crew member amidst the incoming mob, she acted. "Grab onto me! Let's go inside!" she commanded, pushing through the throng with augmented strength and taking Grace firmly by the arm.

**Grace:** Startled by the cyborg's sudden intervention but recognizing the urgency, she allowed Causticus to pull her towards the ship. "I need your promise!" she shouted back towards Ermine over the din. "That you take these people back to their worlds! To their planets! And they will be home by noon!" An impossible demand, but born of desperation. They moved swiftly towards the gangplank.

**Acolyte:** Ignoring Garrik's call, he moved *towards* the breached doorway, spotting familiar faces – fellow Path adherents – caught in the crush. "I am of Joseph Scion!" he called out, trying to rally them. "I too am of Joseph Scion! Let me through! I must spread the Path!" He gestured for them to follow him. He began preaching, attempting a sermon to calm or organize the crowd. However, his passionate, amplified words had the opposite effect. Instead of calming, they seemed to ignite a primal fervor. The entire mass of people surged *towards* him, a wave of bodies threatening to engulf him. He realized, too late, he was in danger of being trampled.

**The Situation Escalates:** From within the densest part of the mob near the breached door, flashes of light erupted – the overwhelmed security guards were discharging their energy weapons. Screams intensified. The crowd surged forward uncontrollably.
*   Acolyte was knocked down, taking injury from the trampling feet above him.
*   Grace and Causticus, caught in the forward momentum, found themselves almost carried towards the ship, surfing the wave of panicked bodies. Causticus managed to grab onto the floating chassis of Primus Rex as the administrators carrying it were also swept along.
*   A stray energy beam lanced through the chaos, striking the female miner Ermine had selected moments before. She fell, instantly dead.
*   Aboard the *Valkyrie*, Captain Douji's voice boomed over the hangar intercom: "Cease this at once!" Simultaneously, the ship's external weapons systems began visibly powering up. The *Valkyrie*'s engines whined as they spooled, and the main gangplank began retracting.

**Garrik:** Seeing the chosen miner fall, a grim thought surfaced: *Well, now they're definitely going to need a miner.* He redoubled his efforts, scooped the still-dazed Vanessa into his arms ("Oh, Garrik! How romantic!" she murmured obliviously), and made a final dash, scrambling onto the retracting gangplank just in time.

**Grace & Causticus:** Propelled by the crowd and Causticus's grip, they reached the gangplank and hurried aboard the relative safety of the *Valkyrie*.

**Caelen:** Safely aboard with his drones now loaded, he turned to the armorer amidst the flashing lights and sounds of conflict outside. "Stephen!" (The armorer had finally introduced himself). "What can I do? What can I do to help?"
"Oh, well, this is fantastic!" Stephen grinned, seemingly unfazed. "I was just talking about the opportunity to test some of these weapons!" He handed Caelen the antique Beretta shotgun.
"I haven't fired one of these since I was like... eight years old!" Caelen protested nervously.
"Aye, it's okay. Don't I worry, lad. Look..." Stephen stepped behind Caelen, guiding his stance. He hit a control, and a nearby viewport slid open like a car window. "Either just take aim. There's the safety." *Click.* "Now just... shoot one of those grubby protesters!" Stephen activated a targeting assist linked to Caelen's own interface. Caelen hesitated, aimed, and fired. The shot connected. A figure in the crowd below crumpled. "Woo! Boy, you're a natural! That felt good, didn't it?" Stephen exclaimed.
"I... I'm not so sure," Caelen stammered, looking disturbed. "I mean, it's defense of the mission like this is... I get that this is military, you know, we're sort of deputized, as it were, to defend the ship. But... no. It didn't feel good."
"Ah, don't worry. You get very used to it after a lot of these," Stephen replied nonchalantly.

**Causticus:** Arriving on deck, she witnessed Caelen firing into the crowd under Stephen's supervision. Concerned about Grace's reaction, she attempted to steer her away. "Oh, hey, did you see this part of the ship?" she tried, pointing vaguely deeper into the vessel. But Grace, hyper-aware, saw Caelen lower the weapon.

**Acolyte:** Scrambling to his feet amidst the ongoing chaos below, he saw the gangplank nearly fully retracted. He pointed towards the ship, shouting encouragement to any Path members nearby (though none seemed able to follow), and then made a desperate, full-speed dash, leaping the final gap onto the deck just as the ramp sealed.

**Ermine:** Eesha bodily threw Ermine onto the deck. Taking in the scene – Garrik and Vanessa aboard, the chosen miner dead, Caelen firing into the crowd, Acolyte barely making it – she knew securing the ship was the only option. Some designated security personnel were clearly lost in the mob outside. "You, cyborg!" she called out to Causticus, recognizing her technical aptitude. "I'm very sorry, I don't know your name yet... We need to make sure that the airlock is open to allow the ship out without exposing any of the people in the hangar to the vacuum of space! Do you think you could do that?"

## Escape to Space

"I can... yeah. I can try my best," Causticus replied, moving to the nearest relevant control interface.

"I'm granting you temporary administrative access," Ermine declared, using her high-level clearance to override standard protocols via her own interface.

Causticus felt the system privileges flood her senses. She initiated the complex sequence: the inner airlock door behind the *Valkyrie* began to open. Simultaneously, the ship lifted from its docking clamps with a hiss of escaping gases and umbilical disconnections, maneuvering smoothly into the airlock chamber. Behind them, the hangar remained a scene of violence and panic, though many in the crowd were simply caught in the crush, not actively fighting.

As the *Valkyrie* cleared the inner threshold, Causticus expertly timed the sequence. She attempted to subtly embed a persistent backdoor into the ship's systems using the temporary admin access, but the Federation's millennia-old security architecture proved too robust for such a rapid infiltration; the attempt failed. However, her primary task succeeded flawlessly.

Just as the inner door began to cycle shut, a figure in massive, whirring power armor, similar in build to Eesha's, sprinted from the depths of the mob, launched into a desperate dive, and tumbled headfirst through the narrowing gap. The figure executed a practiced combat roll on the deck as the heavy door slammed shut behind them. "Looks like I made it in time!" the newcomer announced breathlessly.

With the inner door sealed, Causticus triggered the outer door cycle. The airlock vented atmosphere harmlessly into the void – a silent explosion of dust and debris. The ship slid out into the quiet vacuum of space. Instantly, the chaotic noise from the hangar was cut off, replaced by the profound silence outside the viewports. The *Valkyrie* drifted sedately away from Acheron Station, the turmoil left behind physically, but its echoes reverberating among the newly assembled, disparate group aboard.

## Immediate Aftermath

A tense silence fell over the main deck area where most had gathered.

Ermine sighed, pressing her fingers to her temples. "No," she murmured to Eesha, who placed a comforting, armored hand on her back, "it really wasn't. And I'm not sure how it has got to that point. The Space Station administration need to start shaping up." She began interfacing with the ship's long-range comms. "I'm going to send some comms out to make sure that now that our mission has safely made it out and we're in time for our jump... supplies need to be provided to those civilians who are stuck, and onward transport needs to be arranged as a priority."

Causticus approached Ermine. "There are several unauthorized people here," she reported coolly, accessing the now-verified passenger list against those present. "What are we going to do about them?" She indicated Garrik, Vanessa, and Acolyte.

"Ah, yes, good point," Ermine acknowledged. "If you could provide me with a list of names, I'm sure that we can go and have a talk to our unauthorized visitors to agree how they will make best use of their time here on the *Valkyrie*."

"Should we not put them in a kind of makeshift prison or something?" Causticus suggested bluntly. "Since they're obviously not civilized people?"

"I think that will depend very much on what they have to say for themselves," Ermine countered reasonably. "We are a small crew heading into a very uncertain situation. And if experience has taught me anything, we need to make the best use of the skills that we have. Even if those skills weren't quite intended to be part of this party."

"But," Causticus pressed, "I did notice one person that was extremely fanatic. I don't think he can be very useful." Her gaze flickered towards Acolyte. "Also," she added, turning her attention pointedly to Caelen, "one guy... he's unauthorized to use weapons, and he was shooting at people. Although *I* just secured the ship under *your* authorization, he had nothing like that. What are we going to do about *him*? Are you going to reconsider the prison thing?"

All eyes turned to Caelen. "What?" he stammered, looking towards Stephen for support. "Actually, I had explicit authorization from the ship's armorer!"

"What's he talking about?" Stephen feigned ignorance, stepping back slightly. "What the... what the fuck, man? Give me back that weapon that you're not supposed to have!"

"Is this true?" Ermine asked Caelen sternly. "Did you fire on civilians whilst your life was not in danger?"

"I defended the ship!" Caelen insisted. "Under extremely close supervision from the ship's armorer!"

"You can't defend a ship from unarmed people while having a bunch of weapons in your hands!" Causticus retorted. "No, that's not a valid reason. We should put him in prison."

"I say we should all calm down," Acolyte interjected, stepping forward. "We've all been led here along the same path. We've all found ourselves in the same place." He subtly manipulated his own bio-interface, attempting to project a calming bio-frequency or perhaps release carefully modulated pheromones towards the group, trying to dampen the rising hostility.

Garrik, meanwhile, subtly caught Ulrich's eye and jerked his head almost imperceptibly towards Causticus. Ulrich gave a slight, noncommittal nod, mentally filing the interaction away. Garrik then pulled Vanessa close, engaging in an overt display of affection, hoping to deflect further scrutiny. "Yes! We made it!" Vanessa whispered, clinging to him. "Oh, Garrik, that was... my God. I haven't felt that turned on since our wedding night!"

"Since our wedding night?" Ermine muttered under her breath, overhearing. "You're not even married yet..."

"Yes, yes, I know you have made the right choice," Garrik assured Vanessa loudly.

Grace Augustine, having witnessed the shooting and the subsequent arguments, stood apart, shaking her head slightly. "This is a bunch of fucking misogynistic loyalists," she mumbled to herself, her voice filled with disillusionment. "What the hell am I *doing* here?"

As the internal tensions simmered, the *Valkyrie* adjusted its course, accelerating away from the station city and aligning itself for the long journey towards the edge of the Acheron system, and the jump gate that promised passage to the mysteries of Trappist-1. The chaos of the hangar was behind them, but a new set of conflicts was just beginning within the confines of the ship.
