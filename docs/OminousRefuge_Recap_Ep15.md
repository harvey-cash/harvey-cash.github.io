# The Neutronium Workshops

The vast, semi-circular enclosure faded behind them as the group pressed further into the alien complex beneath Vexis. Passing through immense, naturally formed rocky archways that separated the colossal underground chambers, they emerged into a central expanse. The space seemed almost limitless, stretching into darkness in most directions, but ahead, three distinct archways beckoned, similar to the one they had just traversed.

Straight ahead, an eerie blue light pulsed, accompanied by the low hum and rhythmic pumping sounds of heavy machinery. Peering through this distant archway, Caelen Vesir could glimpse an enormous machine – a colossal cuboid block, many meters across, resembling solid black neutronium. It whirred and shifted, depositing a fine, shimmering filament of black metal onto a steadily growing spherical orb below it, clearly mid-construction. Caelen confirmed it appeared to be a single, building-sized machine working on this one object. This was just one potential path; Caelen counted at least four or five other archways branching off this central hub, like radial spokes, though their destinations were obscured from this vantage point.

Through a second visible archway, there was no sign of machinery. Instead, the void of space itself seemed visible, strangely illuminated by a gentle, pulsing glow of blues, greens, and other colours.

A third archway, the only other one clearly visible without moving further into the hub, revealed nothing but absolute darkness. No light, sound, or motion emanated from within.

Commander Ermine Lakeford noted the sphere being constructed resembled the very transport pods they had arrived in, almost identical in form. It seemed like a miniature version of whatever technology had brought them here was being actively 3D-printed from neutronium. Caelen wondered if this was a continuous production line.

# Cautious Exploration

Deciding to investigate the manufacturing area, Caelen moved forward slowly and cautiously, hoping the others – Ermine, Dr Grace Augustine, Eesha, Ulric, Sandro Destroci, and Gary Gallagher – would follow. The group advanced, attempting to remain undetected within the alien environment. Though their individual levels of stealth varied, they managed to proceed without immediate alarm. Ulric had joined them, eager to find any means of escape back towards Empire space and potential profit.

Stepping through the archway, they found themselves unequivocally inside a neutronium processing and manufacturing facility. Enormous, building-like structures formed what felt like a city grid, towering above them. Relatively narrow alleyways, still the width of city streets to the humans, separated these blocks. Looking up, they saw the structures capped by a roof far above. On the flat tops of these "buildings," multiple large, black neutronium cubes floated and whirred. The undersides of these cubes dispensed the shiny black filament, constructing various objects.

The transport sphere Caelen had initially spotted was indeed being printed on one surface. On another nearby surface, a similar cube was vibrating almost imperceptibly fast, constructing something much smaller – perhaps only a meter across and a couple of meters tall – with incredible speed. Glowing lights adorned the vast walls of the chamber, and the alleyway they peered down terminated in a final, wide structure emitting vague pinging sounds and adorned with many lights.

Sandro, Gary, and Ulric stared up at the transport sphere being printed. Ulric voiced his surprise, "Well, I did not honestly think that we would simply walk out of where we were put and find a spaceship to use. But if a transport pod brought us here, then maybe this transport pod, in the middle of being constructed… we could get in there and turn it into a ship."

Caelen, though outwardly composed, was inwardly impressed and slightly embarrassed not to have considered the possibility himself. He subtly tried to mask his surprise from Ulric. Meanwhile, Sandro and Gary kept a noticeable distance from Eesha. Without consulting the others, Sandro, accompanied by Gary and Ulric, moved towards the base of the structure where the pod was being printed.

Eesha, ever the professional, remained near Ermine, awaiting orders, her loyalty sworn after the directive from Fate to report to Commander Lakeford. Ermine, however, felt uneasy about the group potentially splitting up, especially if they planned to use the pod for escape – how would they retrieve Garrik, Joseph, Causticus, and the others left behind in the enclosure? She scanned the area, trying to determine if any guards were present. Like Caelen and Grace, who also surveyed their surroundings, she initially saw none of the humanoid droids like those that had found Eesha earlier. A fragile sense of security settled over them – perhaps this area wasn't actively patrolled.

Suddenly, the vibrating steel block working on the small object stopped, retracted slightly, and moved away out of sight. From their position on the ground level, many floors below the work surface, they couldn't see what had been completed. However, as they drew closer to the base of the structures, they noticed imperfections in the sheer walls – cracks, uneven surfaces, almost like handholds in a dry stone wall. Scaling these seemed possible.

Sandro and Ulric were already conferring at the base of the structure supporting the transport pod. They seemed to conclude climbing was the only way and began their ascent. Ermine voiced the concern that if they didn't follow, the Empire representatives might claim the only visible pod for themselves, assuming they could operate it. The pod they were aiming for was still actively being printed, filament still flowing onto its upper sections.

Caelen considered the risks of climbing. The fall would be several stories, but the lower gravity on Vexis (roughly half standard G) might make it harmful rather than instantly lethal. He consulted with Ermine and Grace, proposing they scale the structure. None of them possessed personal anti-gravity tech like feather fall devices. Just as they hesitated, a particularly loud roar from the colossal alien creatures battling back near the enclosure echoed through the chambers, accompanied by faint tremors in the ground – a reminder that this manufacturing room was just one part of a larger, potentially dangerous complex, and lingering too long might be unwise.

# The Workshop Roof

With a shared sense of urgency, the decision was made. Eesha, utilising the strength of her powered armour, grabbed Ermine and began punching handholds into the structure's side, effortlessly carrying the Commander upwards. Caelen and Grace scrambled up after them, following the path Eesha forged, reaching the top shortly after Sandro, Ulric, and Gary.

From this new vantage point, several stories high, the situation became clearer. The nearly complete spherical transport pod dominated the surface they stood on, its top section still receiving layers of neutronium filament from the imposing black block overhead. This block was suspended by a long, golden-black mechanical arm, similar in design but vastly larger than the food delivery mechanisms in the enclosure.

Looking across to the other work surfaces, they could now see more clearly. On the platform where the fast-moving printer had just finished, stood a lone, motionless humanoid figure. Clad in white robes, the last residual glow from the printing process faded from its form as they watched. It was the size of a normal human.

Further away, past this solitary figure, an enormous blast of light illuminated the entire cavernous chamber. It emanated from a vast display screen, the size of multiple skyscrapers laid side-by-side, built into the far wall. Displayed on it was a slightly holographic, 3D image of Queen Caroline the Undying. Faint, uninterpretable glyphs scrolled beside her image before freezing into a static display. The humanoid figure below remained stock still.

Ermine scanned the other work surfaces, seeing only complex lumps of neutronium in intricate shapes she couldn't identify. Grace, however, applying insight, looked beyond the immediate shapes. Considering what an advanced race capable of manipulating neutronium might build, she recognised structural components – beams similar to those supporting the archways they'd passed through. She deduced these were likely spare parts being printed for the facility's maintenance.

Caelen, with sharper perception, took in even more detail across the roughly eight visible workstations. He noticed one printing shiny, retro-reflective tiles – he could see pinpoint reflections from his own flight suit bouncing back. Peering through the relative gloom towards another fast-moving print head, he made out the distinct shape of *shoes* being formed. Another humanoid figure was being printed. Looking further, he spotted *two more* humanoid figures in the early stages of printing.

Then, the connection clicked. The finished figure wore illustrious white robes, ornate, reminiscent of the ceramic-tile aesthetic Queen Caroline favoured. Though printed from neutronium, the detail suggested the clothing might appear as real fabric up close. The two figures currently being printed wore predominantly green and purple clothing respectively. Caelen recalled the colossal, Myconid-like creatures they'd seen – the Keepers. Their colour schemes matched these avatars being printed: white for the finished one, green and purple for the new ones. He remembered the orange-hued Keeper seemingly at odds with the others back in the jungle enclosure. The finished avatar strongly resembled Queen Caroline, confirming the link between the giant Keepers and these human forms.

While they absorbed this, Gary gave Sandro a boost as he attempted to clamber onto the hot, newly-formed surface of the transport sphere, only to jump back, remarking on the heat. He and Ulric conferred again, looking up at the still-active printing mechanism.

# Orders and Objectives

Eesha turned discreetly to Ermine. "What are your orders, Commander? What are we doing here?" Before Ermine could fully process, Eesha added, "Fate did ask that we collect samples of everything that we can and then take them back to her."
"For what purpose?" Ermine inquired.
"To feed into Primus Rex," Eesha replied flatly. "To synthesize weapons that we can use to destroy all the aliens."
"What about all the humans on these planets as well?" Ermine pressed.
"They'll be fine," Eesha stated, seemingly convinced. "My understanding is that the weapon synthesizing machine… it targets alien DNA."
Ermine considered this. "I think our mission at the moment is to just gather as much information as we can whilst we're here about the aliens. And also to make sure that we all get out alive, really. And for that, we'll have to go back for the others. So I think at the moment, we just continue as we are, work out what's going on with this pod, and go from there."
"Roger that," Eesha acknowledged. Then, glancing towards the Syndicate and Empire members eyeing the pod, she asked, "Shall I stop them from potentially stealing our one exit?"
"I wouldn't do that just yet," Ermine cautioned. "I think that we are all going to need to work together to get out of this. And I don't think it would be prudent to start infighting right now."
Ermine heard the distinct *scrunch* of Eesha's armoured glove tightening on her shock baton, then relaxing. Eesha's face remained impassive, but the tension was palpable. "Copy that," she finally said. Ermine mentally braced for future conflict.

Caelen conferred with Ermine, "Do you guys think we should try and plan a route back to the others, but maintain this avenue open? I agree with what you said earlier, Ermin, in that the further we venture, the more worrisome it is that we won't be able to link up with our comrades."
"Yeah," Ermine agreed. "Because it's not like it's particularly easy to get out of where they currently are. It feels like the further we go on, the more likely it is that we're going to have to fight our way through, back to where they are, break in, rescue them, and then leave."
"The concern is that we might trap ourselves back there," Caelen mused. "If we venture back, our exit route might then be blocked off without our control."
Ermine added, "And as well, looking at it from… depending on what information we gather about this alien race and what their intentions are… we might *need* that weapon that Primus Rex is synthesizing. We don't have any information about any of this stuff that's going on."
"Ideally," Caelen suggested, "we want a way of calling them to us."
"But that would still involve them getting out of the enclosure," Ermine pointed out.
"For sure," Caelen conceded. "But that seems like minimizing the amount of crossover through any kind of security barrier. Otherwise, we're about to cross over some kind of barrier to head back, and then all of us cross over once more. If there's a way we can do it minimizing the number of people and the frequency at which we cross any kind of barrier... that would be ideal. But how? Primus Rex can't come through the same way we did. Maybe that should be our priority: finding an alternative route *back* to where they are, actually."
"Yeah," Ermine agreed. "But we also don't want to lose the chance of the escape pod. We don't know if, once this is constructed, it might be lifted up and taken away somewhere else."
Caelen countered, "But realistically, if we haven't figured out a way to get our friends back, then we're just hedging our bets on taking that escape pod. And then doing what? Leaving without them? If we're considering that option, then that's one thing, but I don't feel like we're even considering that as an option. Abandoning them. And therefore, it's irrelevant."
"Well, it feels like it isn't an option," Ermine stated firmly. "Because if we leave Primus Rex there… he could effectively be used as a weapon of genocide against the humans, if the aliens worked out what to do."
"So whilst we don't want to miss this opportunity, as it were," Caelen concluded, "it doesn't really even become an opportunity until we're all together."
"Have we got any way of communicating back with them at all?" Ermine asked. Attempts to establish an uplink failed; communications were still blocked.
Caelen recalled the viewing dome in the enclosure area. "The dome seemed like the only visual connection between our underground area and the upper balcony. If there's a way of attracting their attention and communicating there..." He confirmed that their standard gear likely included small, general-purpose devices capable of blinking messages via laser or coded light pulses – a sci-fi equivalent of semaphore or Morse code. If they could establish line-of-sight, communication was possible.
"I'd like to scope out that opportunity," Caelen decided. "I want to go back to the dome area and just at least look for longer than just a quick glance, which is what we did last time."

# The Sentry and the Revelation

As Caelen turned, contemplating the long trek back towards the enclosure, he froze. From their elevated vantage point, looking across the expanse towards a different section of the far wall they hadn't inspected closely, stood one of the colossal Myconid aliens – a Keeper. It was stock still, unmoving. Caelen observed it patiently. It didn't react, didn't shift. It didn't look quite like the others they'd seen engaged in the conflict.

He noticed its construction – metallic, gold and black, reminiscent of the sandworm droids on Lyria and Queen Caroline's palace guards on Graft. It wasn't biological. It stood impassively amidst the towering workstations that reached its waist height. Caelen looked around for a loose object, anything to throw to gauge its reaction to sound, but found nothing. His sidearm blaster pistol, however, could serve the purpose. Deciding against throwing the weapon itself, he took careful aim and fired a single shot at the wall far behind the droid, well away from their position, hoping to elicit a reaction without drawing attention directly to them.

A small white point of light appeared on the droid's otherwise featureless black head-analogue. Like an eye, this light scanned the surface, eventually fixing on the direction the shot had come from. After a moment of assessment, it seemed to dismiss the noise, swept its gaze around briefly, and then winked out. The droid remained motionless.

It was a sentry, Caelen realised. And an intelligent one. It hadn't simply reacted to the noise; it had scanned, assessed the potential threat, and decided it was negligible. That level of decision-making was far more unnerving than simple automated defence. Moving past it would require extreme caution, as they were very exposed on these high, open work surfaces.

The sheer scale of the environment clicked into place. These weren't just random structures; they were workstations, desks designed for creatures the size of the Keepers. If scaled up twenty times, a human would feel like they were in a room with several tables, each equipped with a 3D printer, and a long desk at the end holding the main display screen. This was *their* workshop.

A cascade of insights followed, triggered by this understanding, Caelen and Ermine conferring and analysing. *Who was this workshop for?* Clearly, the colossal Keepers. *What made them think these creatures were merely animalistic monsters?* Perhaps simple anthropocentric bias. A rat likely views a human as a monster. Grace recalled the intense, intelligent eye contact she'd made with the purple Keeper through the enclosure glass – it had studied them as much as they had studied it.

*Who built this place? This entire underground complex?* The Keepers. *Why was the Dyson Sphere around Trappist-1 constructed so recently, on a galactic timescale?* The Keepers built it.

The pieces slammed together. This facility, and by extension the entire Vexis complex, was built *by* and *for* the Keepers. They were the intelligent, tool-using species here. *So why did they intervene to stop Queen Caroline from glassing half of Graft? Why transport the Valkyrie survivors and the Drybridge tribals here?*

The enclosure. The drugged food. The observation windows. Ominous Refuge. It wasn't a prison. It was a sanctuary. A zoo.

*Graft itself* was a conservation project for *Homo sapiens*. The human settlements, the Basin Clan, the Drybridge people – they were being preserved in their "native" habitat from the Keepers' perspective.

*So why the conflict between the orange Keeper (Caroline's avatar-linked one) and the other three?* The others disapproved of her actions. Caroline, using her humanoid avatar, had clearly become deeply invested in her role as the "Undying Monarch," ruling over her conserved humans, enjoying their worship. She had spent decades, perhaps centuries, in this role within the confines of the Graft preserve.

Then the Valkyrie arrived – *external* humans, "wild specimens" breaching the controlled environment. Caroline panicked. Fearing exposure of the project, or contamination, or perhaps censure from her peers for letting the situation occur on her watch, she accessed Federation and Empire data, identified the newcomers as "galactic humans," and ordered their annihilation to prevent any information leaking out.

But the other Keepers intervened. They stopped the destruction, gathered the "endangered specimens" (both the natives and the Valkyrie crew), and brought them here, to the Vexis facility, for safekeeping. Now, those other Keepers were printing their *own* humanoid avatars – the white, green, and purple figures – perhaps to interact with the humans themselves, or to manage the project more directly now that Caroline had proven unstable or had overstepped her bounds. She wasn't a lone agent, but perhaps one whose methods were now being questioned or superseded by her colleagues after her rash actions. Her attempt at genocide was likely a severe breach of their conservation protocols. Was this project perhaps even unsanctioned by their wider civilization? An illegal zoo?

*And the Dyson Sphere?* Why build it? It wasn't necessarily *for* the zoo. More likely, the Keepers, being a vastly advanced civilization, undertook a massive energy harvesting project by constructing the Dyson Sphere around Trappist-1. Realising later, or perhaps as part of the planning, that sentient life existed on Graft (humans descended from ancient colonists), they implemented the conservation project as mitigation – a way to preserve the species whose habitat they were fundamentally altering for their own energy needs. Like building a wildlife refuge next to a new hyperspace bypass. They got the energy, and received "planning permission" to keep the natives alive in a controlled environment.

The implications were staggering. Humanity, or at least this branch of it, was akin to an endangered species being managed by vastly superior aliens whose casual infrastructure projects could doom entire worlds. Ermine realised the terrifying position they were in. The Federation, the Empire – they would undoubtedly see these Keepers as an existential threat.

And then there was Primus Rex, the anti-alien superweapon sitting back in the enclosure. If they communicated with the Keepers and revealed its existence… would the Keepers still see humans as a species worth conserving? Or would they perceive them as a disease-bearing pest harbouring a deadly threat, requiring immediate eradication? Engaging with their keepers seemed essential, yet fraught with unimaginable peril. The path forward was dangerously unclear.
